(Public Law 602), which require the compilation of this annual report be repealed. This report cost $3,780 to prepare.\n\nAll of the information found in this report is available to Congress on a more immediate basis through Congressional committee oversight and budget hearings and the FDA Annual Report. We have concluded that this annual report serves little useful purpose and diverts agency resources from more productive activities.\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House, September 21, 1978.",
