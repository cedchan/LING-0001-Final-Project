The Nation is proud of you and of the many in NASA, the Services, and the private companies which have combined to make such a successful manned space flight team.\n\nEverything in the President's office came to a halt as Foreign Minister Debre of France and I watched with mounting excitement the magnificent launch of the Saturn 1B. You can well imagine the great pleasure which filled the room as word came of your successful insertion into orbit.\n\nThe path to the moon takes courage, ability, and devotion to our goals. You are making a major stride on this star-studded way.",
