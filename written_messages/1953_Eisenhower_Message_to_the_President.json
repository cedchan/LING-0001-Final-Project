The Government of the U.S. shares wholeheartedly with you and your associates your feelings about the workers of East Berlin who by their heroism have demonstrated that totalitarianism has not extinguished the desire for freedom in the enslaved countries of Eastern Europe. I can assure you that this government will study carefully the proposals you have outlined in your message with a view to employing every peaceful means to lift the burdens of occupation from the German people.\n\nDWIGHT D. EISENHOWER",
