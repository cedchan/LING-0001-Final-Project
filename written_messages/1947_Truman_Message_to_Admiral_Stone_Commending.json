    "text": "ON THE OCCASION of the abolition of the Allied Commission for Italy, with which you have been intimately associated since its inception and of which you have been Chief Commissioner since July, 1944, I wish to express to you the sincere appreciation of the United States Government for the splendid service which you have rendered your country and the very real contribution which you have made to the Allied cause.\n\nThe purpose of the Allied Commission was only partially to insure security in the theater of a great battle. Equally important has been the guidance and assistance which the Commission has given to the new Italy in its work of reconstruction and its rebirth as a true democracy. With the support and cooperation of your British and American colleagues you have made an outstanding contribution to the achievement of both these high purposes of the Allied Commission in Italy.",
