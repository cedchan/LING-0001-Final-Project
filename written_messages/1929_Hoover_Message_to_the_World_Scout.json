The assembling of fifty thousand young men and boys from seventy different races and nationalities, in good fellowship without competition, and the self discipline which makes this possible are in themselves without precedent, and constitute, I trust, an augury for development of common ideas and friendship amongst nations.\n\nAs Honorary President of the Boy Scouts of America, I think I may speak on behalf of the millions of boys in the United States who have received benefits from scouting, and I send my hearty congratulations to the assembly.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
