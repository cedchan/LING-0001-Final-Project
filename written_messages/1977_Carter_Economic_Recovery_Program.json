    "text": "To the Congress of the United States:\n\nI am proposing to you today a two, year $31.2 billion economic recovery package, whose budgetary costs will be divided almost equally between fiscal years 1977 and 1978 (Table 1). The main components of the program are:\n\n--an increase of $4 billion in authorizations for local public works;\n\n--an expansion of public service employment by 415,000 jobs;\n\n--an expansion of training and youth programs under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) by 346,000 positions;\n\n--an increase in the countercyclical revenue sharing program designed to pay out an additional $1 billion a year at current rates of unemployment;\n\n--a $4 billion program of tax reform and simplification for individuals, through an increase in the standard deduction;\n\n--individual tax rebates, and payments to Social Security, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Railroad Retirement beneficiaries,' which will total $11.4 billion;\n\n--an optional credit against income taxes equal to 4 percent of payroll taxes or an additional 2 percent investment tax credit for businesses.\n\nWhile a healthy housing industry is also critical to economic recovery, this area requires long-term commitments, rather than a short-range program. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development is now developing a long-term housing program for low and middle income families, which will contribute to sustained economic growth.\n\nThe economy I found when I took office had 7.5 million Americans out of work, 1.4 million full-time workers forced\n\nTABLE 1 .--Budgetary Cost of the Economic Recovery Program Above Current Levels\n\n(In billions)\n\nFY 1977 FY 1977 FY 1978 FY 1978\n\nBudget Budget Budget Budget Authority Outlays Authority Outlays (Appropria- or reductions (Appropria- or reductions tions) in receipts tions) in receipts\n\nIncreased Countercyclical Revenue Sharing 0.5 0.5 0.6 0. 6 Public Service Employment 0.9 0.7 3.4 3.4 Skill Training and Youth Programs in CETA 1.5 0.3 1.3 1.6 Public Works ($4 billion authorization) 2.0 0.2 2.0 2.0 Tax Reform and Simplification for In- dividuals (increase in standard de- duction) 1.5* 5.5* Business Tax Reduction 0.9 2.7 Tax Rebate and Payment to Social Security, S.S.I., and Railroad Retire- ment Beneficiaries 1.8 11.4\n\nTOTAL STIMULUS PACK- AGE (Reduced Receipts Plus Increased Outlays) 6.7 15.5 7.3 15.7**\n\n* While the tax reduction will apply to the full year 1977 tax liability, withholding rates will only be reduced for part of 1977, since passage of the law will come after the year is partly over.

The outgoing Council of Economic Advisers conservatively estimated that our economy operated in 1976 at approximately $132 billion below its high employment potential; every household in our country lost approximately $1,800 per year as a result. The nation lost approximately $35 billion in federal tax revenues and approximately $10 billion in state and local revenues because of inadequate economic performance. Last year, expenses caused by the recession--such as unemployment compensation--were $22 billion higher than in 1973, the last pre-recession year. Economic growth has declined for three consecutive quarters. Most economists have projected that, without further stimulus, the economy would grow by an inadequate 4.5-5% in 1977. The severe weather this winter will probably reduce growth even further, if no action is taken.\n\nA vigorous U.S. economy is vital to our domestic welfare as well as to world stability and order.\n\nIn preparing this detailed economic package I have been guided by several principles:\n\nA. Continuity and Consistency. Because we sought a sustained expansion in consumer spending and business investment, we have developed a two-year program, which will provide stimulus in both this and the next fiscal year, and will also retain enough flexibility so that we can adjust the program up or down should circumstances require. This two-year program will provide the private sector with a genuine opportunity to plan ahead.\n\nB. Speed. Because of the need for an immediate stimulus to consumer purchasing power, we have included an $11.4 billion tax rebate and cash payment section in our package which, if promptly enacted by Congress, would permit us to mail checks to taxpayers this spring. It is simply impossible for public works and public service employment programs to get money into the economic stream that quickly.\n\nC. Fairness. Because we wanted to target the benefits of this program to those most in need, the bulk of the reduction in personal income taxes will go to low and middle income taxpayers (Tables 2 and 3). The business tax reductions have been specifically designed to reduce costs and provide incentives not only for large businesses but for small ones as well. The spending and job creation programs will be targeted to the hard core unemployed and to those communities hurt most by the recent recession.\n\nD. Effectiveness. Our program only promises what can realistically be done. We are proposing major expansions of existing programs within a short period of time. To force more money, faster, into the system would risk poor administration.\n\nE. Limitation on Permanent Budget Cost. Because we are committed to a balanced Federal budge for fiscal year 1981, we want to hold down the size of permanent spending increases or tax reduction. The tax rebate and many of the spending programs are temporary, and will end as\n\nTABLE 2.--Estimated Effects of the Administration's Tax Rebate Program, Distributed by Adjusted Gross Income Class\n\n(Calendar Year 1976 Levels of Income)\n\nTax change resulting from the fifty dollar per capita rebate ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME CLASS Amount Percentage Cumulative ($000) ($ millions) distribution percentage percent) distribution (percent)\n\nLess than 5 --984 10.3 10.3 5-10 --2,010 21.0 31.2 10-15 --2,223 23.2 54.4 1 5-20 --1,904 19.9 74.3 20-30 --1,695 17.7 92.0 30-50 --564 5.9 97.9 50-100 --169 1.8 99.6 100 or more --36 0.4 100.0\n\nTOTAL --9,585 100.0",
