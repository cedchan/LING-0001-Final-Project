    "text": "My dear Commander:\n\nThe annual \"Buddy Poppy\" campaign, under the auspices of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, is a fitting symbol of the sacrifice of those who died in the service of our Country, and should remind us of the obligations and sacrifice demanded of all good citizens in times of peace.\n\nThe fact that the manufacture of these poppies gives employment to disabled ex-service men, in the hospitals and elsewhere, adds to the worthiness of the cause. I am glad to give my hearty endorsement to this worthy enterprise.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
