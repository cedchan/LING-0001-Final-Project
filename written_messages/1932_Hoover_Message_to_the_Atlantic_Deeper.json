The development of the natural water channels with which the United States is so richly blessed has for many years been an active interest with me. They provide an economical means of transportation of bulk goods that is of immense benefit to farmers and the heavy industries. These benefits reflect to the whole nation in increased buying power of the agricultural communities and in lessened costs to the consumers. Twice as much work on these inland waterways has been accomplished in the last three years as in any comparable period in our history.\n\nWe have new problems before us in the matter of waterways. We must work out the problem of regulation of transportation by water: First, because the cut-throat competition now going on in certain cases is making impossible the entry and maintenance of adequate services upon these channels. And second, this cut-throat competition is not only injuring waterway traffic itself but it is damaging our other great arm of transportation, that is the railways. There is a place for both of these in our system, and their development can be made of mutual interest. A study of these problems by your Association would be a contribution to the proper development of the waterways and the securing of the advantages which they offer.\n\nI wish you success in your labors to promote the development of these great national services. Yours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
