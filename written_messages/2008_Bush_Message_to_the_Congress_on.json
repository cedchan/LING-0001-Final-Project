In accordance with this provision, I have sent the enclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication, which states that the national emergency declared with respect to the Government of Cuba's destruction of two unarmed U.S.-registered civilian aircraft in international airspace north of Cuba on February 24, 1996, as amended and expanded on February 26, 2004, is to continue in effect beyond March 1, 2008.\n\nGEORGE W. BUSH\n\nThe White House, February 6, 2008.",
