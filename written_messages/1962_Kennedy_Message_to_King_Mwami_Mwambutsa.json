We know that your people, like ours, cherish individual liberty and national independence. Therefore, we share with the people of Burundi the knowledge that these goals are achieved and can be maintained only at the cost of unremitting labor and sacrifice.\n\nAmericans also share with the people of Burundi a 'profound respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter. We look forward to your participation in world councils as befits a sovereign nation.\n\nThe people of the United States of America will work to strengthen the bonds of friendship between our two countries. We anticipate a future in which our two peoples shall work together in the cause of freedom, dignity and peace. Sincerely,\n\nJOHN F. KENNEDY",
