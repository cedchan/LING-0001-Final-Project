The plan details the activities of Federal agencies in FY 1980 and 1981 toward developing improved world-wide weather observations and services and the United States effort to conduct a comprehensive program of research to further the development of the World Weather Program.\n\nOur ability to forecast the weather and understand the dynamics of climate is an important aspect of developing and executing effective policies in many areas of national endeavor. Events over the last year have demonstrated how interwoven are our national goals with those of other countries. This is essentially true with respect to international meteorology. The World Weather Program was formulated so that the United States could join with other countries to establish goals to better understand and forecast the global weather. The sharing of resources data and ideas to attain these goals is accomplished through the Global Atmospheric Research Programs sponsored by the World Meteorological Organization and the International Council of Scientific Unions and the operation of the World Weather Watch.\n\nI commend to your attention and review this important plan.\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House, November 14, 1980.",
