I understand you have enlarged your numbers by 100,000 since the last count.\n\nYour present total of 700,000 represents a powerful force. In your work you strengthen two of our most cherished traditions: the freedom of the American press, and the opportunities of American citizenship. With your help, our newspapers are swiftly distributed to the homes and working places of our people. With your earnings and experience, you are better able to prepare yourselves for careers of your choice.\n\nI am delighted to wish you well.\n\nDWIGHT D. EISENHOWER",
