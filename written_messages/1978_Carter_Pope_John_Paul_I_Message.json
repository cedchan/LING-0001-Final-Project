We rejoice in the renewal of leadership for your Church.\n\nIn a world of rapid change, the basic needs of humanity remain the same: peace, justice, equity and the opportunity for life with dignity. These are still the supreme challenges that face us. Your voice and your efforts, in the tradition of your predecessors, can be an inspiration and a hope for all those who struggle to meet those challenges.

Sincerely,\n\nJIMMY CARTER",
