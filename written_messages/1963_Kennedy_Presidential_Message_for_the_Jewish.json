    "text": "ROSH HASHANAH, the start of a new year and the period of the Jewish High Holy Days, affords me a welcome opportunity to extend my felicitations to all Americans of the Jewish faith.\n\nThe heritage and religious traditions of Judaism call, for a solemn review, at this time, of your deeds and the aspirations of your hearts, so that your lives may be judged and the ennobling goals of your faith reconfirmed. It is also an appropriate time to resolve to take whatever steps may advance the goal of a lasting and universal peace among nations.\n\nWe enter the New Year with both renewed hope for a lessening of tensions between peoples and nations and disappointment in the continuing fires of conflict around the globe. We are committed to the continuing pursuit of liberty and justice, and neither illusion nor disappointments will distract us from our objective. In this basic effort we need the support and commitment of every citizen.\n\nI am sure that all Americans, whatever their faith, join me in extending to each person celebrating Rosh Hashanah best wishes for a happy new year.\n\nJOHN F. KENNEDY",
