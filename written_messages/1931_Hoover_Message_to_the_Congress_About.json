    "text": "To the Congress of the United States:\n\nI inclose herewith a report which the Secretary of State has addressed to me in regard to the claim of George J. Salem against the Government of Egypt. This claim grows out of the improper exercise of jurisdiction over Mr. Salem by the native courts of Egypt respecting a charge of forgery of deeds and out of the retention by the Egyptian authorities of Mr. Salem's deeds for a period of over four years. These actions caused him to lose opportunity for the advantageous sales of his land and entailed the expenses necessary in defending himself in the native courts of Egypt and also in the mixed tribunals of Egypt. In the latter tribunals he sought a remedy for the injury above recited, but he received a further injury through what is considered by this Government to be a denial of justice.\n\nIt will be noted that the Egyptian Government in a note addressed to the American minister at Cairo, dated March 20, 1930, agreed to the arbitration of the claim.\n\nI recommend that an appropriation in the amount suggested by the Secretary of State be authorized in order that the expenses which it will be necessary to incur on the part of the Government of the United States in the prosecution of the claim to final settlement may be met.\n\nHERBERT HOOVER The White House, January 26, 1931.",
