    "text": "To the Congress of the United States:\n\nSection 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the enclosed notice, stating that the Panamanian emergency is to continue in effect beyond April 8, 1989, to the Federal Register for publication.\n\nThe actions and policies of the Noriega/Solis regime in Panama continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. If the Panamanian emergency were allowed to lapse, the current sanctions imposed against the Noriega/Solis regime, including the blocking of Panamanian governmental assets, would also lapse, impairing our Government's ability to apply economic pressure on the Noriega/Solis regime. In these circumstances, I have determined that it is necessary to maintain in force the broad authorities that may be needed to deal with the situation in Panama.\n\nGeorge Bush\n\nThe White House,\n\nApril 6, 1989.",
