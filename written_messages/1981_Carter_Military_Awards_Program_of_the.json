    "text": "To the Congress of the United States:\n\nForwarded herewith in accordance with the provisions of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1124 are reports of the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation on awards made during Fiscal Year 1980 to members of the Armed Forces for suggestions, inventions and scientific achievements.\n\nParticipation by military personnel in the cash awards program was authorized by the Congress in 1965. More than two million suggestion submissions since that time attest to the success which the program has had as a means of motivating military personnel to seek ways of reducing costs and improving efficiency. Of those suggestions submitted, more than 350,000 have been adopted with resultant tangible first-year benefits in excess of one billion dollars.\n\nOf the 73,326 suggestions which were submitted by military personnel (including Coast Guard military personnel) during Fiscal Year 1980, 11,520 were adopted. Cash awards totalling $967,155 were paid for adopted suggestions during Fiscal Year 1980. These awards were based not only on tangible first-year benefits of $31,163,369 realized from adopted suggestions during the fiscal year, but also on many additional benefits and improvements of an intangible nature.\n\nEnlisted personnel received $795,679 in awards during Fiscal Year 1980 representing 80% of the total cash awards paid during this period. Officer personnel received $194,626 during the fiscal year.\n\nAttached are reports of the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation containing statistical information on the military awards program and brief descriptions of some of the more noteworthy contributions made by the military personnel during Fiscal Year 1980. JIMMY GARTER The White House, January 16, 1981.",
