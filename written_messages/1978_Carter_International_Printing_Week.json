Let Freedom Roll,\" clearly expresses that printing, while it may be a business, is also a cornerstone of democracy.\n\nA vast majority of the graphics arts firms in this nation are not massive corporations, but small, often family owned and operated businesses\u2014true examples of the private enterprise system.\n\nI encourage the printing industry to continue its contribution to the progress of freedom.\n\nJIMMY CARTER",
