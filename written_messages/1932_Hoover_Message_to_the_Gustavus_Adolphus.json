The date of this celebration, however, falls on the second day before the national election at a moment when it will be impossible for me to participate. I deeply regret that this will prevent me from paying the honor which I feel for the memory of the great Swedish hero, and of addressing in person our fellow-citizens of Swedish blood who have given so splendidly of their character and genius to the upbuilding of the American Nation. Yours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
