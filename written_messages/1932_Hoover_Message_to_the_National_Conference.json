Your efforts hold universal significance to Jewry, even as the Jewish people have made a world contribution to spiritual advancement. I will appreciate it if you will extend to those attending your meeting my cordial greetings and good wishes.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER [Mr. Morris Rothenberg, National Chairman, American Palestine Campaign of the Jewish Agency for Palestine, 111 Fifth Avenue, New York City]",
