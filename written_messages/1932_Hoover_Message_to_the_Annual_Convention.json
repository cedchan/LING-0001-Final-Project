Camping occupies so important a place in the life of American youth that it is difficult to overestimate the value of the service of the Camp Directors in embodying to the boys and girls the high ideals of sportsmanship, cooperation and helpfulness which appeal so strongly to the youthful imagination, and consequently have so powerful an influence in shaping character. Yours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
