    "text": "YOU ARE entirely correct in your conclusion that a considerable part of the price difficulties of Kansas wheat farmers is due to the present paralysis of the export market arising from the economic crisis in Central Europe which naturally affects not only them but all countries importing our wheat. The major problem in this connection has been solved by the aid given to Germany in postponement of reparations and to other governments in postponement of debts and I am confident that we will bring about a solution to the remaining difficulties. I know of no greater immediate service to the Kansas farmer and to unemployment generally than the reestablishment of normal economic life in that quarter.\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
