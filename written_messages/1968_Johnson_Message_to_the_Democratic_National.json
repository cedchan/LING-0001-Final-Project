That decision was and is irrevocable.\n\nI ask therefore that my name not be considered by the Convention. I wish to express my deep appreciation to all those who might have wished me to continue.\n\nDuring the remaining months of my term as President, and then for the rest of my life, I shall continue my efforts to reach and secure those enduring goals that have made America great--peace abroad and justice and opportunity at home.",
