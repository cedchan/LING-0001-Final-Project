    "text": "My dear Senator Walcott:\n\nThe protection and propagation of the useful wild life of the country is of much greater importance than is generally realized and deserves the most careful attention. The biological facts should be first ascertained and measures planned in accordance with them and with the equally important facts of human nature. Such measures can provide a program that will not only be of great economic value, but will also preserve the great human values of sportsmanship and the outdoor life. I am glad to learn that the Seventeenth Annual Meeting of the American Game Conference is about to canvass this problem anew, and I will be obliged if you will express to those present my cordial greetings and best wishes for a fruitful discussion. Yours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
