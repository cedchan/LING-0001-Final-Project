    "text": "I send greetings to those celebrating the fifth anniversary of the Rose Revolution.\n\nOne of the most inspiring chapters in the history of freedom was written by the Georgian people during the Rose Revolution. Thirsting for liberty and armed only with roses in hand, citizens throughout Georgia peacefully staked claim to their God-given right of liberty. These demonstrations proved once again, that when given a choice, people choose to live in freedom.\n\nOn this anniversary, Americans honor the brave Georgian citizens who defended freedom, and we renew our commitment to supporting Georgia's democracy, independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. We also look forward to the day when the light of liberty shines on all people throughout the world.\n\nLaura and I send our best wishes. May the God who gave us liberty bless those who are advancing freedom's cause.\n\nGEORGE W. BUSH",
