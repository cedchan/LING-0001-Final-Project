    "text": "Dear Mr. President:\n\nPlease accept and convey to the Hungarian people my sincere condolences on the sad occasion of Prime Minister Antall's death. The Prime Minister's passing is a loss not only for Hungary but also for democratic nations around the world.\n\nAs Hungary's first post-Communist Prime Minister, Mr. Antall will be remembered for his strong leadership and commitment to freedom during these historic times. He was a friend to the United States and an active partner in the international effort to deepen and secure democracy, stability and economic reform in Central and Eastern Europe. His loss will be greatly felt in Europe and here in the United States.\n\nOur thoughts and prayers are with Prime Minister Antall's family and the people of Hungary at this difficult time.\n\nSincerely,\n\nWILLIAM J. CLINTON",
