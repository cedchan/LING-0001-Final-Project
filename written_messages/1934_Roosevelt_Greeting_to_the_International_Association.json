No undertaking is more vital to the welfare of society at this time than that of the prevention and detection of crime. The social order cannot exist except upon the basis of a respect for and observance of the law, and it is only when the people of a country are secure in their homes and in the normal activities of their lives from the depredations of the criminal classes that national progress can be maintained.\n\nThis respect for law and this security are possible only when the administration of justice is entrusted to wise, upright, patriotic and courageous officials.\n\nIt is of great importance that the International Association of Chiefs of Police shall press forward its vigorous efforts directed toward the elevation of the standards of police institutions and officials. Permit me, therefore, to wish you success in your great work.",
