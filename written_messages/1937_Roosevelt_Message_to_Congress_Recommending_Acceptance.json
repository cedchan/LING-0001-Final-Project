Mellon. The conditions under which the gift is tendered are set out in the correspondence, copies of which are transmitted herewith.\n\nThe works of art thus offered to the Government constitute one of the finest and most valuable collections in existence, containing only objects of the highest standard of quality.\n\nIt is with a keen sense of appreciation of the generous purpose of the donor and the satisfaction that comes with the knowledge that such a splendid collection will be placed at the seat of our Government for the benefit and enjoyment of our people during all the years to come, that I submit this matter to the Congress.\n\nThe Attorney General and the Trustees of the Smithsonian Institution have conferred with representatives of the donor and will be glad to discuss the necessary legislation with the appropriate committees.",
