    "text": "DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER has given a lifetime of service and sacrifice to this Nation and to the cause of freedom throughout the world. Through it all he has had his beloved Mamie Eisenhower at his side. She has been an abiding source of strength and understanding for her husband from the days when he served his country as a young lieutenant to the years of his service as a great President, and that is why the entire Nation rejoices as the Eisenhowers approach their 50th wedding anniversary on Friday, July the first.\n\nIt is a historic occasion as well as a cause for private celebration. For not since the time of John Quincy Adams have a President and his First Lady achieved this golden milestone in their lives. All of us owe the Eisenhowers a debt that can only be repaid now with our affection and our deepest gratitude. In the years of peace that they have richly earned as they labor to build the new Eisenhower College, they can truly be sustained by the admiration of their fellow Americans.\n\nI know that Mrs. Johnson and I can speak for all Americans in extending to President and Mrs. Eisenhower our very warm and heartfelt congratulations and our good wishes for many more years of life together. We want them to know that they will celebrate 50 years of marriage in the glow not only of their union but of the Nation's unshakeable esteem.",
