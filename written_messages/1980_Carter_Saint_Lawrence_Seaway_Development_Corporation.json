    "text": "To the Congress of the United States:\n\nI transmit herewith the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation's Annual Report for 1979. The Corporation, an agency of the Department of Transportation that is financed by income received from tolls and other charges, earned $11 million in 1979, up from $9.9 million in 1978. It is responsible for the operations and maintenance of that part of the Seaway within the territorial limits of the United States, and for vessel traffic regulation and other safety-related maritime activities. This report has been prepared in accordance with Section 10 of the Saint Lawrence Seaway Act of May 13, 1954, and covers the period January 1, 1979 through December 31, 1979.\n\nIn 1979 the Saint Lawrence Seaway, jointly operated by the United States and Canada, celebrated the twentieth anniversary of its opening to deep-draft navigation with the Seaway's third highest cargo tonnage year. Overall, 848 million metric tons of cargo have moved through the Seaway since it was opened in 1959. This waterway is one of the most important commercial routes for the shipment of agricultural and industrial cargoes between North America and major overseas ports. It is a proud example of effective international cooperation.\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House, July 24, 1980.",
