Recognizing this, my Administration fully supports the view that encouraging trilateral cooperation on activities of a scientific and technological nature can contribute much to building a permanent structure of peace in the Middle East. We will continue to support the development and strengthening of scientific and technological activities that enhance relations between the peoples of Egypt, Israel and the United States.\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House, September 29, 1980.",
