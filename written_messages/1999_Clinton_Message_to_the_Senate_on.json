    "text": "To the Senate of the United States:\n\nI am gratified that the United States Senate has given its advice and consent to the ratification of the Amended Mines Protocol of the Convention on Conventional Weapons.\n\nThe Senate and my Administration, working together, reached agreement on a detailed resolution of advice and consent to ratification, including 13 conditions covering issues of significant interest and concern. I will implement these provisions. I will, of course, do so without prejudice to my Constitutional authorities. A condition in a resolution of advice and consent to ratification cannot alter the allocation of authority and responsibility under the Constitution, for both the Congress and the President.\n\nI am grateful to Majority Leader Lott, Minority Leader Daschle, and Senators Helms, Biden, Leahy, and the many others who have assisted in this ratification effort. It is clear that the practical result of our work together on the Protocol will well serve the critical humanitarian interest of protecting civilians from the dangers posed to them by landmines, as well as the imperative requirements of ensuring the safety and effectiveness of U.S. military forces. In this spirit, I express my hope that the Protocol will lead to further sound advances in the development of the international law of armed conflict.\n\nWILLIAM J. CLINTON\n\nThe White House, May 24, 1999.",
