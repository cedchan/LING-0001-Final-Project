These amendments provide procedures for peaceful settlement of disputes arising under the Convention. The report of the Department of State is enclosed for the information of the Senate.\n\nSince entering into force in 1975 this Convention has provided an important focus for international concern about the protection and effective management of our oceans and for practical and constructive actions by Parties in the control of marine pollution. These amendments will make the Convention even more effective. I recommend that the Senate give prompt consideration to them and advise and consent to their acceptance.\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House,\n\nFebruary 6, 1979.",
