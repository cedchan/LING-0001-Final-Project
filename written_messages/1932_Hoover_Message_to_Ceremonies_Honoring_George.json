I have long held that the Federal Government evoked a type of socially-minded service of exceptional unselfishness and breadth of vision, and your distinguished record in Washington, followed by many achievements of like color in civil life, should be a stimulus to others as well as a profound satisfaction to yourself. Yours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER [Hon. George B. Cortelyou, President, Consolidated Gas Company, New York City]",
