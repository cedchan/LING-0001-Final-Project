I acclaim Greek achievement in winning that struggle and then repairing the devastation it had caused, and in continuing to play an important part in the defense of the free world.\n\nI am proud that Greece and the United States have stood together during this difficult period. The partnership of our countries is a striking example of the way in which free nations working together can contribute to the peace and security of the international community. Most respectfully,\n\nDWIGHT D. EISENHOWER",
