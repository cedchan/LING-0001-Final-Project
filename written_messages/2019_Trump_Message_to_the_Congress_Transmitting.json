The Agreement is an important part of my Administration's efforts to rebalance trade in North America and to modernize our trade relationship with Mexico and Canada. The Agreement will create significant new opportunities for American workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses by opening markets in Canada and Mexico and eliminating barriers to United States goods, services, and investment.\n\n\nApproving this Agreement is in our national interest. I look forward to the Congress expeditiously approving the legislation.\n\n\nDONALD J. TRUMP\n\n\nThe White House,\n\n\nDecember 13, 2019.",
