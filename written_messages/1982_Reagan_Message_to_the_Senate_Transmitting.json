    "text": "To the Senate of the United States:\n\nWith a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith a certified copy of a protocol to the North Atlantic Treaty on the accession of Spain, signed in Brussels on December 10, 1981 on behalf of the United States and the other parties to the North Atlantic Treaty. I transmit also for the information of the Senate the report made to me by the Secretary of State regarding this matter.\n\nSpain's rededication to the values and purposes underlying the North Atlantic Treaty, and her decision to seek full partnership in the effort to maintain Western security, are historic developments and a source of inspiration in these troubled times. Spain's strategic location, and human and material resources, will make a major contribution to the security of the Alliance. Accordingly, I urge that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to this protocol.\n\nRONALD REAGAN The White House, January 26, 1982.",
