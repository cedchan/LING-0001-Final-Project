He helped bring Christianity to the Irish people. His generosity and love of liberty shaped Ireland's history and culture, and through generations of immigrants, those values have helped shape America.\n\nWe are grateful for the many ways Irish-Americans have blessed our country. They have helped to expand our economy, create our communities, and defend our homeland. Through their public service, they have strengthened our democracy, and their dedication to faith and family has enriched our Nation's character.\n\nLaura joins me in sending our best wishes for a happy St. Patrick's Day.\n\nGEORGE W. BUSH",
