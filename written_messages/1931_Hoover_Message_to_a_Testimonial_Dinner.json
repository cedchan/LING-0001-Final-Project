I should like to share in person in paying honor to such a useful and distinguished citizen, whose work as scientific researcher, teacher, and author has done so much to forward the attack upon the problem of cancer in particular and of disease in general. Such a career is a service and an inspiration to humanity, and deserves the tribute of public praise. Yours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
