The influence of his benevolent spirit and his idealistic faith has grown with time, and has been a potent force for peace, right dealing and progress in the State which he rounded. I share in spirit the reverence being paid to his memory, and I ask you to greet for me all those who take part in this observance. Yours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
