As newspaperboys today, you have a great opportunity to gain the experience which can make you the leaders of tomorrow.\n\nYour constant willingness to help in many community activities throughout the year is already a sign of your growing maturity and sense of leadership. The strength of our American community life depends upon the voluntary services of thousands of citizens like you.\n\nBest wishes for your success and happiness in your continuing service to our communities and Nation.\n\nDWIGHT D. EISENHOWER",
