    "text": "To the Senate of the United States:\n\nI transmit herewith, for advice and consent of the Senate, the Treaty of Friendship between the United States of America and the Republic of Kiribati. The primary purpose of the Treaty is to settle on terms acceptable to both governments the conflicting claims to 14 islands in Kiribati (formerly the Gilbert Islands) in the South Pacific Ocean, and to establish a regime of cooperation, particularly regarding security arrangements and fisheries. The report of the Department of State is enclosed for the information of the Senate.\n\nThe Treaty and Agreed Minute meet the practical interests of both countries and will satisfy the desire of the Kiribati people that their sovereignty over 14 of the islands in their country be unencumbered by a conflicting claim of the United States.\n\nThe Treaty will protect United States interests by assuring non-discriminatory future access to Kiribati fishing grounds which supply fish to the canneries of American Samoa. The Treaty also promotes the interest of American Samoa by encouraging joint ventures using the facilities constructed by the United States on Canton Island. As well, any military use of the islands by third parties is to be a subject of consultations with the United States, and third parties may not use United States-built facilities without United States agreement.\n\nThe Treaty will further United States foreign policy and security interests in promoting peace, security and development of the region. I recommend that the Senate give early consideration to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House, January 24, 1980.",
