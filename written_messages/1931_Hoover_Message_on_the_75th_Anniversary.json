It would give us great pleasure if it were possible for us to be present, but other engagements will not permit.\n\nI will be obliged, however, if you will express my cordial greetings to those gathered for this happy occasion and my profound appreciation of the tremendous service which Berea College, both by its own work and by its example, has done in widening the service of education and in development of the character of the previous youth of our country. The service of the College has been memorable and I speak the heart of the Nation in wishing for it many years of ever increasing usefulness. Yours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
