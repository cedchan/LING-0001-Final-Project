    "text": "To the Senate:\n\nI transmit herewith an international agreement regarding the regulation of production and marketing of sugar and an annexed protocol concerning transitional measures, signed at London on May 6, 1937, by the delegates of the United States of America and certain other countries, to an international conference held for the purpose of considering the problems of such regulation. The agreement and protocol were signed in respect of the Commonwealth of the Philippines by a delegate representing the Commonwealth in the United States delegation.\n\nThe instruments have my approval and I request the advice and consent of the Senate to the ratification of the agreement. The agreement is designed to come into force on September 1,1937, and it is a matter of great practical importance that the Senate give consideration to it at the present session. After the action that the Senate may take on the agreement, action by the Philippine Assembly will be necessary to implement the commitments made thereunder by the Commonwealth before I shall be in a position to ratify the agreement.\n\nThe attention of the Senate is invited to the Report of the Delegate of the United States to the London Conference which I transmit with the agreement.",
