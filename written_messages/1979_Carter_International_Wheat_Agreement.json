    "text": "To the Senate of the United States:\n\nWith a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Protocols for the Fourth Extension of the Wheat Trade Convention and Food Aid Convention constituting the International Wheat Agreement, 1971, open for signature in Washington from April 26 through May 17, 1978. The Protocols were established by a Conference which met in London on March 23, 1978.\n\nI transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Protocols.\n\nThe Protocol for the Fourth Extension of the Wheat Trade Convention, 1971, extends the Convention until June 30, 1979, and maintains the framework for international cooperation in wheat trade matters. It also continues the existence of the International Wheat Council.\n\nThe Protocol for the Fourth Extension of the Food Aid Convention, 1971, extends until June 30, 1979, commitments of donor member states to provide minimum annual quantities of food aid to developing countries.\n\nDeclarations of Provisional Application of both Protocols were signed and deposited for the United States on May 17, 1978, allowing our country to continue full and active participation in the International Wheat Council and Food Aid Committee. The Council and the Committee have granted the United States an extension through June 30, 1979, to deposit instruments of ratification.\n\nIt is my hope that the Senate will give early and favorable consideration to the two Protocols so that ratification by the United States can be effected and instruments of ratification deposited no later than June 30, 1979.\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House,\n\nMarch 15, 1979.",
