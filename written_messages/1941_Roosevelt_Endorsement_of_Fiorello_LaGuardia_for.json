I have known and observed New York's Mayors since that time.\n\nI am not taking part in the New York City election but, because the City of New York contains about half the population of my State, I do not hesitate to express the opinion that Mayor LaGuardia and his Administration have given to the City the most honest and, I believe, the most efficient municipal government of any within my recollection. The fact that the City's election has no relationship to national policies, but is confined to civic policies, is attested by the fact that the Constitution of the State provides for the municipal election in off years when neither a Governor nor a President nor members of the House of Representatives or Senate of the United States are to be chosen.",
