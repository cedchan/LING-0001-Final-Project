I also pledged my administration to helping all of our countries meet the goals of the alliance.\n\nRecognizing that fulfillment of our goals will require the continuation of the joint effort beyond 1971, I wish to inform the Conference--and through you, your respective governments--that the United States will be prepared to extend mutual commitments beyond the time period foreseen in the charter of Punta del Este. In determining the scope of the United States effort, we will want to examine carefully with you at that time the requirements of the hemisphere, in the light of progress made through self-help measures and the contributions which by then some of your countries will be able to make to one another to further the common effort.",
