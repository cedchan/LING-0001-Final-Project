Americans nurtured a deep respect and admiration for Cardinal Wyszynski as Primate of Poland. He played a vital role in helping to safeguard deep and enduring values which both our peoples share, and in the development of close relations between our two countries over the past quarter-century. My compatriots and I fully share Poland's deep sense of loss.\n\nRONALD REAGAN",
