    "text": "To the Senate of the United States:\n\nI submit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to ratification, the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. This Convention was adopted at a Vienna meeting of government representatives on October 26, 1979, and was signed by the United States on March 3, 1980. The Convention establishes an international framework for improving the physical protection of nuclear material during international transport as well as for international cooperation in recovering stolen nuclear material and in responding to serious offenses involving nuclear material.\n\nThe United States has been a leader in the international campaign to prevent the proliferation of nuclear explosive devices. The Congress and I have cooperated in enacting the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 to strengthen this critically important effort.\n\nThe Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material was a United States initiative called for by that Act. It complements our non-proliferation efforts by dealing with threats to nuclear material that may arise from terrorist groups. This is a gap in the current international structure, and I urge the Senate to act expeditiously in giving its advice and consent to ratification. I also transmit herewith, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State concerning the Convention.\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House, May 9, 1980.",
