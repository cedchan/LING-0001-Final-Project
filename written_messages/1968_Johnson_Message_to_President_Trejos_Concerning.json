Simkin, arrives today. The other members of the team, Dr. Howard H. Waldron and Dr. William G. Melson, plan to be in San Jose shortly.\n\nI regret to hear that the volcano continues to erupt, adding to the suffering and losses already sustained. You and the people of Costa Rica have my sympathy in this hour of national emergency. Sincerely,\n\nLYNDON B. JOHNSON",
