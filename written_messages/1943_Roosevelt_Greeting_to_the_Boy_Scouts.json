The job of winning the war and assuring a decent and lasting peace is the concern of every American.\n\nI heartily approve the slogan adopted for the Boy Scouts for 1943\u2014to \"toughen up, buckle down, carry on to victory.\" I am informed that to date more than 327 of those who have been decorated for heroism by our country have been identified as having had scout training.\n\nThe leaders of our armed forces in training camps and on the battle fronts have emphasized the value of scout training in developing knowledge and skill, as well as courage, self-reliance, resourcefulness, and initiative which are proving to be so essential in our determination to win the war.\n\nI have always been a staunch believer in scouting, and now, in time of war, as your honorary president, I urge everyone connected with scouting, boys and men, to see to it that scouting is maintained at its full strength and effectiveness as a practical contribution to the war effort.\n\nCertainly those who help to make boys physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight in these times deserve the appreciation of all who are leaders in America. I am confident that full cooperation will be accorded leaders of the Boy Scouts of America, who are dealing with a most important aspect of our manpower problem.\n\nSo I bring greetings on this the thirty-third birthday to all the members of the Boy Scouts of America and say:\n\n\"Reach out and make it possible for every boy who wants to be a cub or a Scout to have a meeting place and the necessary leadership as a service to your country. Carry on! Make your slogan for 1943\u2014'Toughen up, buckle down, carry on to victory'-a definite and vital part of all of your activities.\"",
