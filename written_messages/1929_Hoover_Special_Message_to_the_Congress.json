    "text": "To the Congress of the United States:\n\nIn order to secure the utmost expedition in the reorganization and concentration of responsibility in administration of the federal bureaus connected with prohibition enforcement, so greatly needed to improve their effectiveness, I recommend that the Congress appoint a joint select committee to make an immediate study of these matters and to formulate recommendations for consideration at the next regular session.\n\nI shall be glad to appoint a committee from the Departments to cooperate with such a committee of the Congress. The National Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement will also cooperate through their studies of the departmental organization.\n\nThe subject involves the transfer of parts of various bureaus and agencies from certain Departments to others and it includes as well the necessity for the unification and strengthening of our border patrols both in connection with prohibition and illegal entry of aliens. As the question embraces numerous laws and regulations in several bureaus, it will require extensive consideration which if given jointly by such committees of the Congress and the Departments prior to the regular session will save many months of delay.\n\nHERBERT HOOVER\n\nThe White House\n\nJune 6, 1929",
