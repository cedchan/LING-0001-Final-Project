Our Nation has ever sought Divine guidance in its hours of thanksgiving and its moments of peril.\n\nOn the high seas, between heaven and the deep, men of all faiths feel a sense of brotherhood with the infinite.\n\nMay this Chapel ever inspire those who pause here to dedicate themselves to the service of their fellow men.",
