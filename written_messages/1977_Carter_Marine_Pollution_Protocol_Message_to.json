    "text": "To the Senate of the United States: I herewith transmit for your consideration the Protocol Relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Marine Pollution by Substances Other than Oil, 1973. I am also transmitting a report on this Protocol from the Department of State.\n\nThe Protocol complements the 1969 International Convention Relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Oil Pollution Casualties by providing that, under certain circumstances, governments may take action on the high seas to protect the interests of their coastal areas from marine pollution caused by substances other than oil. A list of such substances, compiled by the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization, accompanies the Protocol. Under the terms of the Protocol, the list can be amended to reflect future technological developments.\n\nThe Protocol is evidence of awareness by the international community that oil is not the only potential source of marine pollution, and that steps must be taken to prevent or reduce damage from other substances as well. I recommend that the Senate advise and consent to its ratification.\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House, July 25, 1977.",
