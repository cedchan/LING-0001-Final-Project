I have followed the progress of this regional collective security organization with deep personal interest since its inception. The United States believes the instrumentalities which the member governments have created to carry out the Pact's purposes are making an important contribution to world peace. We are glad to participate in these activities.\n\nI have asked Ambassador Henderson to represent the United States in your deliberations, and upon his return to report personally to the Secretary of State and me. I send you my warm wishes for a fruitful meeting.\n\nDWIGHT D. EISENHOWER",
