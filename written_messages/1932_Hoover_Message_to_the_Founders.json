    "text": "THE YOUNG Men's Christian Association has been a tower of moral strength in every community since the earliest childhood recollections of most of the men and women now living, and thus it is almost startling to be reminded that the founder of this great organization, if he were living today, would be only eleven years older than a centenarian. The celebration of Founders' Day on October 11th will be the occasion for much historic and personal reminiscence of that great man, George Williams, and of the stupendous spiritual, educational and material blessings wrought by the association born of his vision and firmly rooted in his indefatigable labors and his optimistic spirit. To the youth of our land, indeed of all the world, it will be a day reminding them of the possibilities of service to millions of others that lie in unselfish application of spiritual insight, devoted industry and warm good-will toward all one's fellowmen.\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
