    "text": "My dear Mr. Ball:\n\nOn the occasion of the National Convention of the Morris Plan Bankers Association in Columbus, will you kindly express my cordial greetings and my interest in their deliberations. I am impressed with the record of the Morris Plan Banks, which in a little more than two decades have loaned more than one and one-half billion dollars to more than seven million people. This record is the best evidence of the service which they render to borrowers requiring that type of credit service. The sound principles on which the system is conducted are indicated by the maintenance of the factor of safety of both principal and interest even during a time of stress upon the country's credit facilities. These banks not only render a most practical service, but promote thrift and thereby eventually increase the patronage of banks generally. I extend my good wishes for a successful convention. Yours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
