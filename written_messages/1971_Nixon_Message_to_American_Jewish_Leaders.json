    "text": "ALL DECENT and law-abiding Americans share your outrage at recent criminal acts of violence against Soviet facilities in this country. You may be certain also that this Administration, reflecting the traditional liberties upon which this country was founded, joins with you in urging freedom of emigration as explicitly provided in Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in its commitment to cultural and religious freedom at home and abroad.\n\nBut acts of violence and lawlessness such as those that have occurred in this country lately will not advance our common cause; they are, as you say, morally wrong and injure that very cause.\n\nThis Administration, in cooperation with local authorities, will use every means at its disposal to prevent such acts and to bring to justice those who perpetrate them.\n\nRICHARD NIXON",
