    "text": "To the Congress of the United States:\n\nIn conformity with Section 4 of Public Law 94-110 of October 13, 1975, I am pleased to transmit herewith the Fifth Report of the United States Sinai Support Mission. It describes the continuing operation of the United States early warning system in the Sinai and its contribution to maintaining the disengagement arrangements between Egypt and Israel under the Sinai II Agreement signed on September 4, 1975.\n\nThe estimated cost for operating and maintaining the U.S. early warning system in Fiscal Year 1978, including all contractor and headquarters expenses, is expected to be about ten percent less than the $12.2 million appropriated. For Fiscal Year 1979, the budget is estimated at $11.7 million.\n\nDuring the six-month period covered in this report, twenty-two minor violations of the Sinai II Agreement were detected. In each instance the violation was an unauthorized aircraft overflight. None of these incidents was serious.\n\nBoth parties to the Agreement recently reaffirmed to the Director of the Sinai Support Mission their full confidence in the manner in which the U.S. is discharging its responsibilities in the Sinai and wished this effort to continue as it is at present.\n\nDramatic developments in the Middle East over the past six months expanded hopes for a comprehensive peace settlement. While the diplomatic process is underway, I believe it imperative that the U.S. continue to meet fully its obligations under existing agreements. The activities of the Sinai Support Mission play an important part in fulfilling these obligations and I urge continued Congressional support for this effective peacekeeping mission.\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House,\n\nApril 24, 1978.",
