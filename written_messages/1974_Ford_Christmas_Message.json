And we pray that the Christmas spirit of generosity and renewal will be with you throughout the coming year.\n\nWe begin 1975 in the midst of many serious challenges. As we work to resolve them, let us be encouraged by counting the blessings we have gained from those who have met similar challenges in the past. Let us draw strength from our unity of purpose and hope from our past resourcefulness. And let us work together to ensure that the good which we have achieved will be strengthened and preserved for our children and future generations.\n\nGERALD R. FORD",
