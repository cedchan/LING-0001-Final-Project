    "text": "My dear Mr. Mease:\n\nAs an expression of man's highest aspirations, religion has been universal among people throughout all history. Worship has played a fundamental role in all social evolution.\n\nGrowing out of the work of the churches and enlarging the field of church activity, the Young Men's Christian Association developed as an institution where emphasis was placed essentially upon Christianity in action rather than upon Christian beliefs and Christian modes of thought. Young men found in it a place where they could carry out their Christian impulses.\n\nIt is difficult to imagine what a difference it would have made if no organization such as the Y.M.C.A. had been developed in this country. Down through the decades the Y.M.C.A. has grown strong. It has adjusted itself to the changing needs of the times. During this recent depression it has done valiant service in providing programs of guidance, education, and recreation for the millions of unemployed young men who have stood in great need of such programs.\n\nI am glad to join with the many friends of the Y.M.C.A. in paying tribute to Sir George Williams, the founder of this great organization. His life should be an inspiration to the boys and young men who find in the Y.M.C.A. the preparation for the social leadership which they are to assume in the future.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nMr. C. R. Mease, Chairman, Founder's Day Committee, Newark, New Jersey.",
