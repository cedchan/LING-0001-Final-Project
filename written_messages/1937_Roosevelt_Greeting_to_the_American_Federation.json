    "text": "My dear President Green:\n\nPlease extend my hearty greetings to the delegates to the American Federation of Labor convention and my hope that your sessions will be productive of constructive plans for the improvement of conditions and for cooperation to this end of workers, management and the public.\n\nIt is reported to me that employment and payrolls have increased greatly in the past year. Very definite strides have been made in the last four and a half years toward the goal set in the organic act creating the Department of Labor. Increased incomes and greater opportunities for employment of wage earners have so raised purchasing power that farmers, merchants, manufacturers and investors all have shared in the benefits.\n\nContinued cooperation among workers and management will serve to consolidate these substantial gains and enable us to go on to greater prosperity and to better standards of living.\n\nI wish much that I could come to the Convention, but as you know, I find it necessary to start my return to the East tomorrow.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nWilliam Green, Esq., President, American Federation of Labor, Denver, Colorado.",
