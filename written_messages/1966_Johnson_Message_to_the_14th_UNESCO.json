Your work is founded on the conviction that peace must mean more than the absence of conflict: it must mean the presence of justice and wider opportunities for human fulfillment. The American people support these goals.\n\nWhat we achieve together can give reality to our common dream: a worldwide human fraternity, based on mutual understanding and respect--and living in peace.",
