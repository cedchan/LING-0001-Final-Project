    "text": "The Greek War of Independence which was launched on March 25, 1821, had a special significance for Americans of that time. Only forty-five years before, the American colonies, too, had declared their independence. For Americans, the Greek struggle was that of a people whose ancient heritage was the source of fundamental ideas of free government on which the American Republic was founded.\n\nOur friendship has continued to flourish and to strengthen, immeasurably enriched by the millions of Greeks who have come to our country to add their unique heritage to the fabric of American life. I am confident that Greek-American friendship will continue to grow and to produce even greater mutual benefits in the future.\n\nMr. President, on behalf of the American Government and the American people, I wish to extend my sincere congratulations on the anniversary of Greek independence.\n\nRONALD REAGAN",
