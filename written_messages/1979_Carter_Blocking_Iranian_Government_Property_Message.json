    "text": "To the Congress of the United States:\n\nPursuant to Section 204(b) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1703, I hereby report to the Congress that I have today exercised the authority granted by this Act to block certain property or interests in property of the Government of Iran, its instrumentalities and controlled entities and the Central Bank of Iran.\n\n1. The circumstances necessitating the exercise of this authority are the recent events in Iran and the recent actions of the Government of Iran.\n\n2. These events and actions put at grave risk the personal safety of United States citizens and the lawful claims of United States citizens and entities against the Government of Iran and constitute an extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.\n\n3. Consequently, I have ordered blocked all property and interests in property of the Government of Iran, its instrumentalities and controlled entities and the Central Bank of Iran which are or become subject to the jurisdiction of the United States or which are or come within the possession of persons subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. I have authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to employ all powers granted to me by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to carry out the blocking.\n\n4. Blocking property and property interests of the Government of Iran, its instrumentalities and controlled entities and the Central Bank of Iran will enable the United States to assure that these resources will be available to satisfy lawful claims of citizens and entities of the United States against the Government of Iran.\n\n5. This action is taken with respect to Iran for the reasons described in this report.\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House,\n\nNovember 14, 1979.",
