Within the last few years trade associations have rapidly developed into legitimate and constructive fields of the utmost public interest and have marked a fundamental step in the gradual evolution of our whole economic life.\"\n\nNo facts have come to my attention which would cause me to change the opinions expressed at that time, rather every development of industry renders trade associations more essential to sound development of our economic system.\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
