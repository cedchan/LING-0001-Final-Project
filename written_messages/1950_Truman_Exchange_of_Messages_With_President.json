The establishment of the sovereign independent republic of India within the Commonwealth represents a final step in India's political transition which closely parallels the political evolution of our own country. Because of our traditional sympathy with India, the people of the United States are particularly happy to send expressions of good will on this occasion.\n\nThe inauguration of India's new form of government and of its new Constitution, and the assumption of office by the first President, constitute an auspicious beginning of the second half of the Twentieth Century. May the future of the new republic, functioning under its democratic Constitution, be characterized by peace, prosperity and good fortune.\n\nHARRY S. TRUMAN",
