    "text": "Private but not too confidential\n\nDear Jack:\n\nI have read in the papers that tonight you and twenty-four members of the Senate are attending the funeral of my old friend Bessie. I knew her many years ago when I was hunting in northern Pennsylvania. She was the pet of the camp and would always come when you whistled and eat out of your hand.\n\nI am sorry, indeed, that Joe Guffey removed the tinkling little bell which was always worn around her neck. It makes me feel so chokey when I think of her untimely demise that I do not think that I could attend the funeral service tonight even if I had been invited.\n\nI understand fully, of course, that this unfortunate hunting accident was not your fault\u2014and I am glad, too, that if Bessie had to go you shot her instead of whistling her up and cutting her throat with a knife. Dear Bessie probably never knew what hit her.\n\nUnder all the unfortunate circumstances attending her death, I hope, nevertheless, that all of you will enjoy the wake.\n\nAs ever yours,\n\nHonorable John N. Garner, The Vice-President of the United States, The Raleigh Hotel, Washington, D.C.",
