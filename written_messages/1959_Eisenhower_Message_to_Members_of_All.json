Everyone appreciates the great strain under which you work--the restricted daily routine, environmental hardships, the separation from families and friends and the isolation from familiar scenes. I salute you all in the name of science for the work you are performing and the sacrifices you are undergoing for the benefit of all mankind. You are participants in a unique venture of peaceful cooperation toward the enrichment of human knowledge. May you have a most productive winter season in Antarctica.\n\nDWIGHT D. EISENHOWER",
