It comes to me as a voice of confidence and of hope for a better world.\n\nAs Commander-in-Chief, I welcome the pledge of fealty from a body of veterans who have served in their country's defense and who, knowing the ardors and the heartaches and the misery of war, dedicate themselves anew to the arts of peace; for peace, too, has its own victories no less valorous than those of war. May I make humble acknowledgment of your generous sentiments concerning my leadership? Happily we are now emerging from the years of depression but I want you to understand how reassuring it is to receive a pledge of faith such as you convey in the name of the Catholic War Veterans.\n\nOurs will be the victory if we set ourselves resolutely to the performance of those spiritual and corporal acts of mercy which have ever been the salvation of men and of Nations. With organizations like yours marshaled in a mighty crusade for peace, we may look forward to a time, let us hope, not far distant, when under the Providence of God, war shall be no more and peace shall be the heritage of men of good will.\n\nVery sincerely yours, Reverend E. J. Higgins, National Chaplain, Catholic War Veterans, Long Island City, N. Y.",
