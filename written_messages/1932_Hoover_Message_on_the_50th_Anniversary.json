The advance in fifty years from that modest beginning is nightly reflected in the splendid illumination of our cities and homes, which we accept by habit without thought of the enormous labors in technical research, business organization and manual skill which have gone into their production. Yours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
