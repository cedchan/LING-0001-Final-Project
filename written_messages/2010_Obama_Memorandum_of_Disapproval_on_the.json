    "text": "It is necessary to have further deliberations about the possible unintended impact of H.R. 3808, the \"Interstate Recognition of Notarizations Act of 2010,\" on consumer protections, including those for mortgages, before the bill can be finalized. Accordingly, I am withholding my approval of this bill. (The Pocket Veto Case, 279 U.S. 655 (1929)).\n\nThe authors of this bill no doubt had the best intentions in mind when trying to remove impediments to interstate commerce. My Administration will work with them and other leaders in Congress to explore the best ways to achieve this goal going forward.\n\nTo leave no doubt that the bill is being vetoed, in addition to withholding my signature, I am returning H.R. 3808 to the Clerk of the House of Representatives, along with this Memorandum of Disapproval.\n\n BARACK OBAMA\n\nThe White House,\n\nOctober 8, 2010.",
