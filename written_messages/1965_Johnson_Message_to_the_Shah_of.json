The friendship between Iran and the United States, strong and enduring, has been enriched by the shared experiences of our two nations. The program of reform and renewal which you have initiated in your country has demonstrated your wisdom and compassion, your perception and statesmanship. The United States is proud to have been associated in your efforts to maintain the freedom of your people and to establish for your country an honored place in the world community of peace-loving nations.\n\nYour Majesty can take great pride from the record of dangers met, obstacles overcome, and progress achieved during this turbulent period of world history. The people of the United States of America join me in expressing to Your Majesty our friendship and high regard and our warm personal wishes to you and your family on this most auspicious occasion. Sincerely,\n\nLYNDON B. JOHNSON",
