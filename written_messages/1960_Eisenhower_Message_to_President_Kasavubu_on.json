The attainment of independence by 13.5 million Congolese is one of the most significant events in Africa during this unprecedented year of 1960.\n\nOn this historic occasion the Government and people of the United States look forward to close and friendly relations with the Government and people of the Republic of the Congo. Sincerely,\n\nDWIGHT D. EISENHOWER",
