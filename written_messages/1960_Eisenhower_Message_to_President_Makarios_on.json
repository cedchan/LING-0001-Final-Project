The United States is a close friend of all parties to these negotiations, and is therefore especially gratified at their happy outcome.\n\nThe Government and people of the United States welcome the independent and democratic Republic of Cyprus to the family of nations, and look forward to maintaining close and cordial relations with the Government and people of Cyprus. Sincerely,\n\nDWIGHT D. EISENHOWER",
