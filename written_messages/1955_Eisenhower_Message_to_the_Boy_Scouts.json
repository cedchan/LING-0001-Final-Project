Self-development and service to others, independence and good citizenship, a sense of brotherhood and responsiveness to spiritual values--these qualities which Scouting fosters mean much to America. To all Boy Scouts I extend congratulations on what they are achieving and on what they promise for our nation's future.\n\nDWIGHT D. EISENHOWER",
