The accomplishments of public broadcasting are well articulated with emphasis on television and radio programming, technological innovation, and human development services.\n\nIt should be noted that the projections of long range Federal financial contributions from the Federal Government exceed levels contained in the Administration's legislative proposal to reauthorize the Corporation for the period FY 1981-85.\n\nThe Annual Report is being forwarded so that it is available to the Congress for its deliberations.\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House, March 28, 1978.",
