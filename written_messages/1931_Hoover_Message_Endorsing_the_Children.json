    "text": "CHILDREN ARE our most precious possession. The Children's Charter was written by 3,500 experienced men and women, after many months of study. It condenses into few words the fullest knowledge and the best plans for making every child healthier, safer, wiser, better and happier. These plans must be constantly translated into action. Fathers and mothers, doctors and teachers, the churches and the lay organizations, the officers of government in the states and counties and towns, all have one common obligation--to advance these plans of better life for the children. I urge upon you an even larger interest in it.\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
