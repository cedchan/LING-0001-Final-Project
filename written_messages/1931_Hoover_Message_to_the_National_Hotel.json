It is to the lasting credit of the American business man that he is facing the future with courage and confidence. It is that spirit, plus the necessary reordering and readjusting of our economic life to current conditions, which will eventually solve the difficulties which confront us. I trust that your exposition may give impetus to improvement not only in the hotel industry, but in business generally. Yours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
