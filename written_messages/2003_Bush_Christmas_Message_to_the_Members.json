Your family and friends and fellow citizens miss you too\u2014 and our whole country is proud of you.\n\nAll who serve in our military are protecting the American people in a time of challenge and danger. You are confronting terrorists abroad so that we don't have to face them in our own country, and so that people around the world can live in peace. By spreading freedom and democracy, you are making our future more secure.\n\nAs your Commander in Chief, I am proud of every one of you. Some of your comrades have been wounded, and we pray for their recovery. Some have given their lives. This Nation will never forget their service and sacrifice, and in this holiday season we pray that God will comfort the families they left behind.\n\nThe liberty we prize is not America's gift to the world; it is God's gift to humanity. Americans are blessed to have men and women like you protecting us, and defending the cause of freedom across the world. May God bless you, and may He watch over our country.\n\nGEORGE W. BUSH",
