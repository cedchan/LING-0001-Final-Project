It is a wonderful preparation for any future employment, and it often provides a useful base for later success in a chosen career.\n\nI admire the dedication and energy of our nation's newspaper carriers, and I hope that their paper routes will continue to bring them rewarding experiences that will enrich their lives in years to come.\n\nJIMMY CARTER",
