That this independence is being reached in harmony and friendship with France is a source of great satisfaction.\n\nOn this memorable day, the Government and people of the United States look forward to close and friendly relations with the Government and people of the Central African Republic. Sincerely,\n\nDWIGHT D. EISENHOWER",
