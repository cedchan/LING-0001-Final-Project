Whether it be of law, business, morals, or that vision which leads the imagination in the creation of constructive enterprises for the happiness of mankind, he who seeks for guidance in any of these things may look inside its covers and find illumination. The study of this Book in your Bible classes is a postgraduate course in the richest library of human experience.\n\nAs a nation we are indebted to the Book of Books for our national ideals and representative institutions. Their preservation rests in adhering to its principles.",
