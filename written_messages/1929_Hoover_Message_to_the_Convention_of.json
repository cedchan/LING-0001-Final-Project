I am daily impressed with the great need for [p.298] extended work of education in the moral, physical and economic benefits of temperance. Since the adoption of the Prohibition Amendment, too many people have come to rely wholly upon the strong arm of law to enforce abstinence, forgetting that the cause of temperance has its strong foundations in the conviction of the individual of the personal value to himself of temperance in all things.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
