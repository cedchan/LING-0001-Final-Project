    "text": "I HAVE BEEN following with deep interest the experimental drilling in connection with the first phase of Project Mohole. The success of the drilling in almost 12,000 feet of water near Guadalupe Island and the penetration of the oceanic crust down to the volcanic formations constitute a remarkable achievement and an historic landmark in our scientific and engineering progress.\n\nThe people of the United States can take pride not only in the accomplishment but in the fact that they have supported this basic scientific exploration. I extend to you my congratulations and ask that you pass them on to the special committee and the staff of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Science Foundation, the Global Marine Exploration Company, and especially to all those on board the Cuss I and attendant vessels who have combined their talents and energies to achieve this major success.\n\nJOHN F. KENNEDY",
