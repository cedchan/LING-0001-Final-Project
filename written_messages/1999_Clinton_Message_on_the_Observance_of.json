But it also delivers a profound reward: the opportunity to show people of every faith what is precious about Islam\u2014its charity, its generosity, and its essential humanity. All people in the world are moved by your observance of Ramadan and by the devotion and dignity that make Islam one of the world's great religions.\n\nAs you welcome the appearance of the new moon and the close of Ramadan, Hillary joins me in extending best wishes for a memorable celebration and for peace, health, and prosperity in the year to come.\n\nBILL CLINTON",
