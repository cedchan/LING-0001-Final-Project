    "text": "Warm greetings to everyone celebrating African American History Month, 1995.\n\nHillary and I join you in marking the brave efforts of the countless Americans throughout our nation's history who have demanded justice, declared an end to segregation, and fought to ensure that every individual has the opportunity to build a brighter future for themselves and their families.\n\nToday, there is a renewed sense of hope in America\u2014a hope based on the idea that our great diversity can unite rather than divide our society. It is the same hope that has inspired African Americans since ur country's beginnings to dream of a nation in which all people enjoy the freedom to make their own lasting contributions to our world. If we are truly to build on history's rich lessons, we must always remember these pioneers' pivotal roles in American history.\n\nOurs can be a land of unprecedented peace and prosperity in the twenty-first century if we have the faith that Martin Luther King described, the faith to \"transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.\" We must never cease striving to bring people together across racial and cultural barriers. This is our generation's most solemn calling and most important challenge.\n\nI urge everyone, during African American History Month and throughout the year, to take up this challenge and to learn more about the black Americans who have made this country great.\n\nBILL CLINTON",
