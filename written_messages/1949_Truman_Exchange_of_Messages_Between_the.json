It is a record of tireless hard work. It is also, I believe, a record of achievement through cooperation. The Organization for European Economic Cooperation so recently established by the countries working together toward full recovery has demonstrated to us all the meaning of true international action.\n\nWe in the United States are proud that we have had a part in this great mutual effort. We are confident that the progress toward true recovery which has been so marked during this first year will continue and that the high goals which have been set will be fully realized.\n\nHARRY S. TRUMAN",
