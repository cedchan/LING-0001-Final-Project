    "text": "My dear Mr. Secretary:\n\nThis year, with the flames of war raging in nations across the Atlantic and Pacific, Navy Day is very close to the hearts of the American people. For them and for myself, I wish on this occasion to assure you of our utmost faith and pride in the ability and integrity of the personnel of the Navy and Marine Corps.\n\nOfficers and men of the naval service have carried on splendidly in fair weather and foul. Their devotion to duty, their spirited endeavor to keep the Navy strong, is an inspiration to those who hold this country's welfare above self.\n\nThere has been a recurrent tendency throughout our history to overlook the Navy and its needs, particularly after a war. We have been correcting this in the last few years. Now, faced with the fact that this nation is entering new, rapidly changing, and unpredictable world conditions, we are embarked on a national defense program that reaches into the home of every one of our citizens.\n\nI know from personal observation, as do you, that industry and our naval establishment today are coordinating their efforts in every conceivable manner, to the end that our Fleet shall be a deterrent to those nations which would plant the heel of dictatorship across this hemisphere.\n\nI take this opportunity to congratulate you and your great organization on these efforts. I have the greatest confidence in the Navy. Its thoughts are directed towards successful prosecution of war, should war unfortunately come, and it constantly strives to be a guardian of our statesmanship.\n\nI pray that it will continue to emphasize, by its strength, our determination to remain a free people, marching steadily along the open road that holds peace of the spirit as well as a full and worthy material life.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nThe Honorable, The Secretary of the Navy, Washington, D.C.",
