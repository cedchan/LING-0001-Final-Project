    "text": "To the Senate of the United States:\n\nI submit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to ratification, the Convention signed at Manila on October 1, 1976, between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines with Respect to Taxes on Income, and an exchange of notes between Secretary of the Treasury William E. Simon and Secretary of Finance Cesar Virata interpreting Article 23(2) of the Convention, done at Washington on November 24, 1976.\n\nThere is no convention on this subject presently in force between the United States and the Philippines.\n\nThe Convention follows generally the form and content of most conventions of this type recently concluded by this government. Its primary purpose is to identify clearly the tax interests of the two countries so as to avoid double taxation and make difficult the illegal evasion of taxation. The exchange of notes confirms that certain provisions of the Philippines tax system comply with the Convention.\n\nI also transmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Convention.\n\nConventions such as this one are an important element in promoting closer economic cooperation between the United States and other countries. I urge the Senate to act favorably on this Convention at an early date and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n\nGERALD R. FORD The White House, January 19, 1977.",
