The growth of our country requires incessant labor on the part of both federal and state authorities in the improvement of this essential basis of transportation. The Federal Government is expanding its activities in these directions, and I am resolved that it shall be unremitting in waterway development.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
