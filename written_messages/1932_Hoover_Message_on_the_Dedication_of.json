It will exercise a permanently stabilizing effect on your community through knowledge that the necessary element to success, a sufficient water supply at all times, has been supplied. The sympathy of the administration and the Congress and the whole-hearted and fine spirit of the people of this community have cooperated to make the completion of this dam possible.\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
