    "text": "My dear Mr. President:\n\nON NOVEMBER 15 your country will commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Proclamation of the Brazilian Federative Republic. I have great pleasure in sending you on this happy occasion my own best wishes and those of the people of the United States.\n\nIt is a tribute to the Brazilian Nation and its leaders that the complete independence of your country was attained by patient adjustment and without bloodshed. The less fortunate people who today do not enjoy independence and freedom can take courage from the lesson in tolerance that your people have given to mankind.\n\nThis occasion is an appropriate one on which to refer again to the traditional friendship of the United States of Brazil and the United States of America. This friendship is based on mutual respect and the New World principle which affirms the right of peoples to work out their destinies without foreign interference. It should be obvious to all that the similarity of our objectives, and our cooperation in working for their attainment, is not due to any mere accident of fate, but to the common ideals which inspire us.\n\nMy memory of the warm welcome and hospitable reception which you and the citizens of Rio de Janeiro were kind enough to give me at the time of my visit in November, 1936, serves to assure me of the cordial reception that will be given to the commander, officers and men who fly this message to you. Believe me, my dear Mr. President,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nHis Excellency Dr. Getulio Dornellas Vargas, President of the United States of Brazil.",
