In my February 22, 1977 message to the Congress, I strongly recommended early enactment of legislation to correct those provisions of current law that cause significant departures from the local prevailing rate principle, and result in an unfair competitive advantage for the Federal Government and unjustifiable payroll costs. A draft bill which would achieve these objectives was submitted to the Congress early last year. I am convinced that this bill will correct the most serious deficiencies in the prevailing rate system and I wish to reiterate my concern for its passage.\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House,\n\nJanuary 24, 1978.",
