    "text": "To the Congress of the United States:\n\nIt is with pleasure that I transmit the third Nationwide Outdoor Recreation Plan to the Congress of the United States, as required by P.L. 88-29 (16 U.S.C. 460/-1 (c)). This Plan has been prepared by the Department of the Interior to address a number of current recreation issues, and assess the existing supply, demand, and opportunities associated with outdoor recreation in America.\n\nThe Plan was derived from a new planning process which maximizes public involvement and leads to specific actions. The rivers and trails directives issued in my 1979 Environmental Message are among the major decisions which originated with this Plan. Also included in the Plan are specific actions related to Federal land acquisition policy, environmental education, recreation access for the handicapped, and energy conservation. The Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Program, which I proposed as one of my urban initiatives, is already helping to enhance close-to-home recreation opportunities, conserving energy while meeting basic recreation needs.\n\nThe challenge of enhancing recreation opportunity cannot be met by government action alone. New partnerships among all levels of government and the private sector will be required. New ways of combining resources from a variety of existing programs must be tested to meet our Nation's recreation needs.\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House,\n\nDecember 11, 1979.",
