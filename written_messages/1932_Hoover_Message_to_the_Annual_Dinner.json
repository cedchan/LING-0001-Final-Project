Wald's untiring efforts in the amelioration of human suffering have rightly earned her the approbation of her fellow-citizens. The Geneseens have cause for pride in numbering Miss Wald among their company. Her position in our national life is unique. Her life has been marked by steadfastness and courage. My best wishes attend the success of the dinner and of the Society.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
