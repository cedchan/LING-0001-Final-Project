    "text": "THE COMING ELECTION is of vital interest to every citizen of your State whatever his or her occupation may be. Your fundamental industries and the welfare of all your people are absolutely dependent upon a protective tariff, which has been guaranteed you by the Republican Platform. I believe in a protective tariff on live stock, hides, wool, and on all products of the farm, the ranch and the mine. Especially do I believe in a protective tariff, not in a competitive tariff, for your beet sugar. Without such protection this industry, so vital to the welfare and prosperity of your State, would be destroyed, your factories closed and your most valuable farm lands forced into other crops and into a market already suffering from overproduction. A large part of my life has been devoted to the mining industry and I have a warm sympathy with as well as understanding of Rocky Mountain problems.\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
