The willingness of young men to devote a month to this training program for better citizenship is proof of good-will in the generation on which will presently devolve the maintenance of our social and political institutions.\n\nI commend the Citizens' Camps to all fathers and mothers and to young men of suitable age in the hope and belief that the camps will show themselves as useful in the future as they have been in the past. Yours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
