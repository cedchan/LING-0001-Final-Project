Our citizens will never rest content until the poorest children in our cities, the loneliest mothers on our most isolated farms, have the comfort and protection of such institutions. I am glad to lend the encouragement of the Presidency to the movement symbolized by National Hospital Day.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
