This program for the cotton producer essentially places the responsibility upon the individual farmer.\n\nHe and he alone will, in the last analysis, determine whether it shall succeed.\n\nThis plan offers the cotton producer a practical, definite means to put into immediate application the methods which Congress has prescribed to improve his situation.\n\nI have every confidence that the cotton producer will face the facts and cooperate fully in the reasonable and practical plan that is proposed.",
