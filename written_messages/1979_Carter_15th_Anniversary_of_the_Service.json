As a former small businessman, I know from first-hand experience how important this SBA program really is.\n\nSCORE volunteers have guided and counseled hundreds of thousands of small businesses over the past fifteen years. Their efforts have helped our nation maintain the healthy small business community that is the backbone of national stability and confidence.\n\nOn this occasion I salute SCORE volunteers and their associates at the Small Business Administration who have helped SCORE grow in numbers, spirit and accomplishment. All Americans can be proud of what this milestone represents.\n\nJIMMY CARTER",
