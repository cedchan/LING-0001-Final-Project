    "text": "To the Congress of the United States:\n\nI am pleased to transmit herewith the Third Report of the United States Sinai Support Mission. This report describes the manner in which the Mission is continuing to carry out its peacekeeping responsibilities by operating an early warning system in the Sinai, as called for in the basic agreement between Egypt and Israel signed on September 4, 1975. This report is provided to the Congress in conformity with Section 4 of Public Law 94-110 of October 13, 1975.\n\nThe report emphasizes the successful completion on February 22, 1977, of one full year of operations. With the completion of initial construction activity, the Sinai Field Mission has had an opportunity to analyze in detail various elements of the Mission's activity. In particular, attention has been directed to improving operating procedures, to upgrading equipment and to reducing personnel through the introduction of advanced technology.\n\nThe parties to the agreement continue to affirm their satisfaction with the role of the United States in the Sinai and the fair way in which the Sinai Support Mission has discharged its responsibilities for the early warning system.\n\nAs our initiatives to help the parties to the Arab-Israeli dispute move toward a resumption of negotiations, it is important that the United States continue to fulfill its commitments. As long as the Sinai Support Mission is able to make a positive contribution to these efforts, I will urge that the Congress continue its support for this important mission.\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House, April 27, 1977.",
