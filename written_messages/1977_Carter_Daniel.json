    "text": "A museum on the grounds of old Tuskeegee Airbase, where black airmen and support troops trained in World War II, is a useful and long overdue tribute to the sacrifice of these brave men. It is highly appropriate that the Air and Industrial Museum is being named for Gen. Daniel \"Chappie\" James Jr., who has served his country with such distinction. Despite segregation at the time, the black troops who trained here compiled an honorable record. Wallace and Wallace Chemical and Oil Corp. is to be commended for setting aside this museum area in their honor and for its plan to restore planes and equipment of the era so that future generations will better understand the contribution of black servicemen who fought and died for their country, and black industrialists and others who have contributed to the nation's economic well-being.\n\nJIMMY CARTER",
