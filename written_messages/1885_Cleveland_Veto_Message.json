    "text": "To the House of Representatives:\n\nI hereby return without my approval House bill No. 1391, entitled \"An act to provide for the erection of a public building at Springfield, Mo.\"\n\nIt appears from the report of the committee of the House of Representatives to which this bill was referred that the city of Springfield is in a thriving condition, with stores, banks, and manufactories, and having, with North Springfield, which is an adjoining town, about 20,000 inhabitants.\n\nNo Federal courts are held at this place, and apparently the only quarters which the Government should provide are such as are necessary for the accommodation of the post-office and the land-office located there.\n\nThe postmaster reports that six employees are engaged in his office.\n\nThe rooms used as a post-office are now furnished the Government free of expense, and the rent paid for the quarters occupied as a land-office amounts to $300 annually.\n\nUpon the facts presented I am satisfied that the business of the Government at this point can be well transacted for the present without the construction of the proposed building.\n\nGROVER CLEVELAND",
