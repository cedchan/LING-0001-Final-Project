    "text": "To the Congress of the United States:\n\nIn accordance with Section 107 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978, I am transmitting an evaluation of the extent to which this Reorganization Plan has alleviated the problems associated with the present administrative structure under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). The evaluation also includes recommendations for a longterm administrative structure under ERISA.\n\nThe study concludes that the Reorganization Plan has significantly alleviated the problems in ERISA administration to which it was addressed: the processing of applications for exemptions from prohibited transaction provisions and the is* suing of regulations. In addition, there have been substantial further reductions in the paperwork burden associated with the Act, and the Department of Labor and the Department of the Treasury have begun cooperative agreements to improve the coordination of their field enforcement activities. Continued improvement is expected.\n\nI am pleased with the success of the Reorganization Plan in simplifying and improving the unnecessarily complex administrative requirements of ERISA. I believe that the establishment of an Interagency Employee Benefit Council, as recommended by the evaluation, will address the problems of the long-term administration of the program. My staff is carefully considering the steps necessary to establish the Council, as a part of my Administration's continuing commitment to making government more effective and less intrusive in the lives of our people.\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House, February 11, 1980.",
