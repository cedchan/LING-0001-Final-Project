Jewish deeds and idealism are written indelibly on the scroll of time. Down through the centuries to our own time there has flowed a continuing stream of enrichment of the spiritual and cultural life of the world. In business, the arts, the professions, philanthropy, citizenship and, above all, in the evolution of the spiritual life of mankind, the race has contributed elements of strength, beauty and tolerance which are the common heritage of all men. On the occasion of the happy festival now being celebrated I wish to extend my heartlest congratulations and most cordial good wishes.\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
