It is organized to provide summary information about the activities of advisory committees, and public access to specific committees and the federal agencies to whom they provide advice.\n\nWith the current government-wide, zero-base review of all advisory committees, the number of existing committees should be sharply reduced. This reduction will be reflected in the next annual report.\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House,\n\nMarch 29, 1977.",
