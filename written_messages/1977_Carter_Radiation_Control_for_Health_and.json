All of the information found in the report is available to Congress on an immediate basis through congressional committee oversight and budget hearings. The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare has concluded that this annual report serves little useful purpose and diverts agency resources from more productive activities.\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House, April 12, 1977.",
