(IEEPA), I hereby report that I have issued an Executive Order (the \"order\") with respect to Iran that takes additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12957 of March 15, 1995.\n\n\nThe order takes steps to deny Iran revenue, including revenue derived from the export of products from key sectors of Iran's economy, that may be used to fund and support its nuclear program, missile development, terrorism and terrorist proxy networks, and malign regional influence.\n\n\nThe order blocks the property and interests in property of persons determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State: \n\nThe order also authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to impose correspondent account and payable-through account-related sanctions on a foreign financial institution upon determining the foreign financial institution has, on or after the date of the order, knowingly conducted or facilitated a significant financial transaction: \n\nI have delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the authority to take such actions, including adopting rules and regulations, to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to implement the order. I am enclosing a copy of the order I have issued.\n\n\nDONALD J. TRUMP\n\n\nThe White House,\n\n\nJanuary 10, 2020.",
