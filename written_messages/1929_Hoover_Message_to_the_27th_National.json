The choral singing that is so distinctively an institution of the race and that has been continued here with undiminished enthusiasm and success is a very positive as well as very delightful addition to the cultural inspirations of this country. I am glad to welcome the twenty-seventh National Saengerfest to be held this evening at Madison Square Garden in New York.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
