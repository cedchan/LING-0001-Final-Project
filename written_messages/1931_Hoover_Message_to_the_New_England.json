I wish to avail myself of this opportunity to express to you and through you to the members of the Council my deep appreciation of the work of your organization has done and is doing.\n\nThe Council has taken upon itself the duties and the responsibilities that it alone can best discharge. It has labored earnestly and effectively for the good of the six states it serves. Furnishing a model of farsighted and intelligent cooperation, it has courageously shown the way to the entire country.\n\nThe people of New England have true cause for gratitude for the splendid efforts of the Council in behalf of the unemployed. There has been no finer cooperation with the agencies concerned with unemployment than that accorded by the Council.\n\nThe work done by the Council is most gratifying. I have every confidence the Council will continue its unstinted efforts. Yours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
