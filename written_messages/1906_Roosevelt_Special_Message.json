Sivewright, Bacon & Co., for damages sustained by their vessel, the British steamship Eastry, in consequence of collisions at Manila in June, 1901, with certain coal hulks belonging to this Government.\n\nI renew the recommendation which I made to the Congress on January 19, 1903, that, as an act of equity and comity, provision be made for reimbursement to the firm of the money expended by it in making the repairs to the ship which the collisions rendered necessary.\n\nTHEODORE ROOSEVELT.",
