The kindness and charity practiced by Muslims during this holiday strengthen friendships, help those in need, and exemplify the compassionate spirit that makes America and the world a better place.\n\nAs Americans of Muslim faith celebrate Eid al-Adha, our Nation is reminded of the contributions that Muslim Americans have made to our religious and cultural heritage. Your values of family, service, and community enrich our society and reflect the ideals on which our country was founded.\n\nLaura joins me in sending our best wishes for a joyous celebration.\n\nGEORGE W. BUSH",
