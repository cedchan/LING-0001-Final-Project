But all the work of the chemist in the laboratory, the scientist in space, and the agronomist in the field will be in vain unless we can learn to live together in peace. No feat of physical science can compare to the feat of political science which brings a just peace to earth.\n\nThe American people and their Government have set the strengthening of peace as their highest purpose in the New Year. I myself am wholly committed to the search for better understanding among peoples everywhere. \"Peace on Earth, Good Will Toward Men\" need not be an illusion; we can make it a reality. The time for simply talking about peace, however, has passed--1964 should be a year in which we take further steps toward that goal. In this spirit I shall strive for the further improvement of relations between our two countries. In our hands have been placed the fortunes of peace and the hope of millions; it is my fervent hope that we are good stewards of that trust.\n\nOn behalf of the American people and myself, I extend cordial greetings and best wishes for the coming year to you and your families and to the peoples of the Soviet Union. Sincerely,\n\nLYNDON B. JOHNSON",
