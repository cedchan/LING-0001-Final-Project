    "date": "1892-02-16",
    "text": "To the Senate and House of Representatives:\n\nThere was passed by the last Congress \"An act for the protection of the lives of the miners in the Territories,\" which was approved by me on the 3d day of March, 1891. That no appropriation was made to enable me to carry the act into effect resulted, I suppose, from the fact that it was passed so late in the session. This law recognizes the necessity of a responsible public inspection and supervision of the business of mining in the interest of the miners, and is in line with the legislation of most of the States.\n\nThe work of the miner has its unavoidable incidents of discomfort and danger, and these should not be increased by the neglect of the owners to provide every practicable safety appliance. Economies which involve a sacrifice of human life are intolerable.\n\nI transmit herewith memorials from several hundred miners working in the coal mines in the Indian Territory, asking for the appointment of all inspector under the act referred to. The recent frightful disaster at Krebs, in that Territory, in which sixty-seven miners met a horrible death, gives urgency to their appeal, and I recommend that a special appropriation be at once made for the salaries and the necessary expenses of the inspectors provided for in the law.\n\nBENJ. HARRISON",
