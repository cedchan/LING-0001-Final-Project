It is most gratifying to see such interest in acquainting officials and citizens with the findings of the nation-wide study and the Conference in Washington, and effective efforts to translate the principles of the Children's Charter into practice. The realization of these ideals would contribute greatly to the health and well-being of the children of Colorado, and I trust that your Conference will be fruitful of inspiration and practical effect. Yours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
