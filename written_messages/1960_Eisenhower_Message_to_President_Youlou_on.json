It is with deep satisfaction that we welcome this historic event.\n\nI recall with great pleasure and appreciation the thoughtful gift which you made to me last year in the name of the Community. This tangible token of affection of the Community and of yourself for the United States will long be remembered.\n\nOn this historic day, the Government and people of the United States look forward to close and friendly relations with the Government and people of Congo. Sincerely,\n\nDWIGHT D. EISENHOWER",
