    "text": "To the Senate of the United States:\n\nI am pleased to transmit the Protocol Amending the Interim Convention on Conservation of North Pacific Fur Seals between the United States, Canada, Japan, and the Soviet Union, signed in Washington on October 9, 1980.\n\nThe Interim Convention was signed in 1957; it replaced an earlier convention on North Pacific fur seals dating back to 1911. Under the two conventions, the herds of fur seals have been protected and managed, and the population has increased from 300,000 animals to approximately 1.7 million. The Interim Convention was extended in 1936 and 1969. A 1976 Protocol further extended the Convention and amended it in order to provide greater protection for fur seals. This Protocol extends the Interim Convention for an additional four years, until 1984. It also reflects the four signatory nations' recognition of the extensions of fisheries jurisdictions which have occurred since the entry into force of the 1976 Protocol.\n\nI transmit also for the information of the Senate the report of the Department of State with respect to the Protocol.\n\nI urge the Senate to act favorably at an early date on this Protocol.\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House,\n\nNovember 12, 1980.",
