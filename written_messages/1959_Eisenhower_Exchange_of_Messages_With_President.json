The American people extend heartfelt sympathy to the Mexican people in this trying time. Although Ambassador Hill has already been in touch with officials of your Government, I want to inform you personally that this Government stands ready to cooperate in any manner it can in alleviating the hardships now being borne by the citizens of Mexico.\n\nWith warm personal regard, Sincerely,\n\nDWIGHT D.
