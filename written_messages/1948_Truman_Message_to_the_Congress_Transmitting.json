    "text": "To the Congress of the United States of America:\n\nI am transmitting herewith the first quarterly report of expenditures and activities under the United States Foreign Aid Program authorized by Public Law 389 of the 80th Congress, approved December 17, 1947. This report covers the activities immediately before and during the brief period from the approval of the Foreign Aid Act of 1947, on December 17, 1947 through December 31, 1947.\n\nBy its enactment of the Foreign Aid Act of 1947, the Congress provided the \"Interim Aid\" to bridge the gap between the end of the United States Foreign Relief Program, authorized under Public Law 84, and the beginning of a general long-range recovery program.\n\nA break in the flow of supplies during this period could have irreparably jeopardized what the long-range recovery program is expected to accomplish. The effectiveness of Interim Aid has made it possible for the European Recovery Program to build on sure foundations which nowhere are undermined by the inevitable ravages of intolerable hunger and cold. No better proof is needed of the wisdom of providing this interim aid.\n\nHARRY S. TRUMAN",
