    "text": "The Editorial Board of \"The Christian Science Monitor,\"Boston, Massachusetts:\n\nThe constructive service which The Christian Science Monitor has consistently rendered to better understanding between nations is widely appreciated in all parts of the world, and it is fitting that on this occasion of the coronation of George VI, America's interest in the progress and welfare of the British Commonwealth of Nations should be expressed in a Coronation Supplement such as you have prepared.\n\nIt is a simple statement of fact, but one which cannot be too often affirmed, that the United States and Great Britain have one great common concern\u2014the preservation of peace throughout the world. While national means and methods of contributing to a peace more secure and more stable may rightly vary, this common objective stands ever a common inspiration.\n\nPeace may not be won with asking, but it can be won with striving, and I was never more convinced than now that the plain people everywhere in the civilized world today wish to live in peace, one with another.\n\nAt Buenos Aires last December the twenty-one American Republics reaffirmed their faith in and support of the peaceful way of international living, and they gave practical testimony to their adherence to the ideals of democratic government and the Christian honoring of their solemn obligations.\n\nThe preservation of peace needs the devoted support of newspapers throughout the world, and it is encouraging to find The Christian Science Monitor devoting itself further to the enlargement of understanding between the English-speaking peoples on this historic occasion.",
