The men and women who fell in America's wars, from Bunker Hill to Khe Sanh and Hue, have brought the promise of lasting peace on Earth closer for us all. Let us prove that their heroism was not in vain. Let us work together to erect a new structure of peace upon the firm foundations they fought so nobly to build.",
