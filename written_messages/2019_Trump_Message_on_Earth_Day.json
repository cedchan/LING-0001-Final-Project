    "text": "Earth Day is a celebration of the abundant beauty and life-sustaining bounty of our natural environment. On this day, we reaffirm our responsibility to protect God's wondrous creation for future generations.\n\n\nFrom the Appalachian Mountains to the golden shores of California, America is blessed with some of the most beautiful scenery on Earth. As Americans, we all share an immense pride in these God-given treasures and a tremendous appreciation for our abundance of natural resources.\n\n\nEnvironmental protection and economic prosperity go hand in hand. A strong market economy is essential to protecting our critical natural resources and fostering a legacy of conservation. My administration is committed to being effective stewards of our environment while encouraging opportunities for American workers and their families.\n\n\nAt the same time that our Nation is experiencing historic economic and job growth, our air and water quality ranks among the highest in the world. Under my administration, we are improving the quality of life for communities across America by strengthening the security and reliability of our drinking water and accelerating spending on water infrastructure. Additionally, we have expanded support for conservation of land, water, and wildlife, and we are reforming land management policies to improve the health of our forests and other Federal lands.\n\n\nAs we observe Earth Day, I hope all Americans will reflect with gratitude on the glorious blessings and awe-inspiring majesty of our planet.",
