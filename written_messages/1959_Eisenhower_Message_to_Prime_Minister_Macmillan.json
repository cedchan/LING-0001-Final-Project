Though I am now visiting in Mexico, I feel impelled to send you instantly my sincere felicitations.\n\nI know what your personal leadership has meant to the efforts to bring about a peaceful and equitable solution, and I share your satisfaction that the foundation has now been established for a settlement acceptable to the Gypriot people which at the same time contributes to the closer cooperation of Greece, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.\n\nPlease convey also to Mr. Lloyd, Mr. Lennox-Boyd, and Governor Foot my admiration for the contribution which they have made in making this agreement possible. With warm regard,\n\nDWIGHT D. EISENHOWER",
