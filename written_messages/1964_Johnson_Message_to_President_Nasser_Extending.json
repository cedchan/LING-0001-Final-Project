In this way, within the framework of the United Nations Charter, African nations are making a vital contribution to world peace.\n\nAs the OAU moves into its second year of activity, it will face new challenges which, I am sure, it will meet in the same spirit it has already demonstrated in the momentous year just past. I and the people of the United States extend to this Organization our best wishes for continued progress toward your high aims.\n\nLYNDON B. JOHNSON",
