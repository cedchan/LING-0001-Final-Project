    "text": "During National Mentorship Month, we recognize the selfless dedication and commitment of countless mentors across the country to the nurturing, leading, and uplifting of America's youth. As they devote their time and energy to helping guide the next generation of leaders, they enrich the lives of others, strengthen our Nation, and build a better future for all Americans.\n\n\nWhether sharing their own experiences or supporting their mentees toward their goals, mentors have an indelible impact on the future of our children and young adults. From faith leaders and coaches to educators and business professionals, mentors come from different walks of life yet share an unwavering devotion to bettering the lives of others. These patriots instill American values in youth across our country: compassion, generosity, individual responsibility, and duty. As young Americans pursue their dreams, they forever carry the timeless values they learned with the confidence that they are supported.\n\n\nThroughout this month, I encourage all Americans to seek ways in which they can mentor America's youth. Together, we can empower and inspire young people to follow their hearts, go after their goals, and pursue their own American Dream.",
