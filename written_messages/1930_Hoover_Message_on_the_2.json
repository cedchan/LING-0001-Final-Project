    "text": "My dear Miss MacVay:\n\nI am heartily in sympathy with American participation in the celebration of the two thousandth birthday of Vergil, whose immortal works have so stimulated the imagination and enriched the cultural life of so many generations. So much of our language and literary are derived directly from the Latin classics that the study of them must ever remain an indispensable part of the training of one of the most valuable types of mind. The youthful struggles to master Vergil's lines have been forgotten by millions who in maturity recall only that he brought to life and the world about us a new meaning and fresh beauty. Yours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
