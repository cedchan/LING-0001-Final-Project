    "text": "To the Congress of the United States:\n\nIn accordance with statutory requirements, I am transmitting to you my proposal for Federal participation in the International Exposition on Energy to be held in Knoxville, Tennessee from May through October 1982. The Congress has already received an FY 1980 budget amendment request, in the amount of $20.8 million, to support Federal participation. The Department of Commerce is submitting the authorizing legislation as well.\n\nIt is my determination that Federal participation is in the national interest. The Exposition will provide for an international exchange of ideas on energy development, innovative energy technology, energy conservation, solar energy, synthetic fuels and other subjects important to the national interest. Moreover, the Exposition will stimulate tourist travel to the United States, thereby improving our balance of trade, promote international cultural exchange and accelerate capital growth and investment in the Knoxville area.\n\nMy proposal includes all statutory requirements: (1) assurance that the Exposition meets all criteria for recognition and has been recognized; (2) a statement that the Exposition has been registered by the Bureau of International Expositions on April 27, 1977; and (3) a plan prepared by the Commerce Department and other interested departments for Federal participation.\n\nThe plan for Federal participation provides for construction of a pavilion and preparation of energy-related exhibits.\n\nI urge that this plan be given prompt and favorable consideration by the Congress.\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House,\n\nAugust 28, 1979.",
