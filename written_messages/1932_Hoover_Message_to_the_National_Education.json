These serve again to remind our people that, however, the national economy may vary or whatever fiscal adjustments may need be made, the very first obligation upon the National resources is the undiminished financial support of the public schools. We can not afford to lose any ground in education. That is neither economy nor good government.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
