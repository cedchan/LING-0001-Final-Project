    "date": "1965-11-02",
    "text": "I HAVE CALLED this Conference with one purpose in mind: to bring together the best minds and the boldest ideas to deal with the pressing health needs of this nation. The urgency of those needs is undeniable: --Nearly 15 million people suffer from heart disease;\n\n--Forty-eight million people, healthy today, will become victims of cancer;\n\n--One-fifth of our children under age seventeen are afflicted with chronic ailments.\n\nMany citizens have been left behind in our advance toward better treatment and better health--some because of inadequate health manpower; others because of obsolete or scarce treatment facilities; and others because health services are not organized efficiently enough to provide first-rate service.\n\nI believe that a great nation can do better. I believe that this Conference can give new strength and energy to our national effort to recruit health professionals, extend health services and improve treatment.\n\nIf we are to launch a new era for medicine-an era even more dramatic than the last a decades--we must begin by setting new goals:\n\n--To increase the life expectancy of our citizens; --To achieve a healthier environment;\n\n--To decrease the infant mortality rate in the United States;\n\n--To improve our understanding and care of the mentally ill;\n\n--To eliminate such diseases as tuberculosis, measles, whooping cough.\n\nOurs is a great opportunity to advance ideas which will contribute not only to a healthier America, but to a better world.\n\nWe have the resources; we need only the will and the leadership.\n\nLet us raise our sights--and unlimber our imaginations.\n\nLYNDON B. JOHNSON",
