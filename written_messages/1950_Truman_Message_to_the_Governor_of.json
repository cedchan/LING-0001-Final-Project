Those who have died or suffered wounds in defense of law and order and of democratic government deserve the gratitude of the Nation no less than those who have died for the same great cause on the field of battle. I am glad to learn that the situation is now under control and that the insular authorities have taken all necessary steps for the preservation of order.\n\nHARRY S. TRUMAN",
