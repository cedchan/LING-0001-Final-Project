On the contrary, I want them to know that the regulations issued are but an integral part of our economy program embracing every department and agency of the government to which every employee is making his or her contribution.\n\nI ask them to appreciate that not only their welfare, but also the welfare of every American citizen depends upon the maintenance of the credit of their Government, and also to bear in mind that every citizen in every walk of life is being called upon, directly or otherwise, to share in this.",
