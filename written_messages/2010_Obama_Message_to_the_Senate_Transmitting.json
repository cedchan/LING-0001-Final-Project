    "text": "To the Senate of the United States:\n\nWith a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Treaty between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Bermuda relating to Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, signed at Hamilton on January 12, 2009. I also transmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty.\n\nThe Treaty is one of a series of modern mutual legal assistance treaties being negotiated by the United States to more effectively counter criminal activities. The Treaty should enhance our ability to investigate and prosecute a wide variety of crimes.\n\nThe Treaty provides for a broad range of cooperation in criminal matters. Under the Treaty, the Parties agree to assist each other by, among other things: producing evidence (such as testimony, documents, or items) obtained voluntarily or, where necessary, by compulsion; arranging for persons, including persons in custody, to travel to the other country to provide evidence; serving documents; executing searches and seizures; locating and identifying persons or items; and freezing and forfeiting assets or property that may be the proceeds or instrumentalities of crime.\n\nI recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Treaty, and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n\nBARACK OBAMA\n\nThe White House,\n\nJune 29, 2010.",
