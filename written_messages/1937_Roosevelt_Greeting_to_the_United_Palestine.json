    "text": "Dear Doctor Wise:\n\nPlease convey my good wishes to the men and women gathering in Washington for the National Conference for Palestine which has been summoned by the United Palestine Appeal. The American people, ever zealous in the cause of human freedom, have watched with sympathetic interest the effort of the Jews to renew in Palestine the ties of their ancient homeland and to reestablish Jewish culture in the place where for centuries it flourished and whence it was carried to the far corners of the world.\n\nThis year marks the twentieth anniversary of the Balfour Declaration, the keystone of contemporary reconstruction activities in the Jewish homeland. Those two decades have witnessed a remarkable exemplification of the vitality and vision of the Jewish pioneers in Palestine. It should be a source of pride to Jewish citizens of the United States that they, too, have had a share in this great work of revival and restoration. It gives me great pleasure to send all who are participating in your deliberations my hearty felicitations and warmest personal greetings.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nDoctor Stephen S. Wise, United Palestine Appeal, Washington, D. C.",
