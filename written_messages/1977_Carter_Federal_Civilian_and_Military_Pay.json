The Advisory Committee on Federal Pay has concurred with this recommendation.\n\nWhile the Federal Employees Pay Council recommended a larger increase, I have decided that the 7.05 percent increase fully satisfies the principles set forth in the Federal Pay Comparability Act of 1970 that Federal salaries be comparable with those in private enterprise for the same levels of work.\n\nI am transmitting herewith the reports of my Pay Agent and the Advisory Committee, as well as a copy of the Executive order I have promulgated to put this pay adjustment into effect.\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House, September 29, 1977.",
