I am also submitting a draft of the legislation proposed by the Commission to accomplish these purposes.\n\nPorto Rico is still suffering from the effects of the disastrous hurricane of September 13, 1928. There exists a real and immediate need for appropriating these funds in order to alleviate the distress due to unemployment on the Island and to enable the Commission to continue its farm rehabilitation program.\n\nThe proposed legislation has my approval and I recommend its immediate enactment.\n\nHERBERT HOOVER THE WHITE HOUSE, January 14, 1930.",
