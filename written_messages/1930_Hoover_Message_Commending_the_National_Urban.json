It is the soil in which self respect takes root, and from which may then grow all the moral and spiritual enrichments of life. The work of the National Urban League to train Negroes in the city to find new lines of occupation is fundamental to the progress of the race. I wish you success in this undertaking. Yours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
