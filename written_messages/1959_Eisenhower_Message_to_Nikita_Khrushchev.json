    "text": "Dear Mr. Chairman:\n\nI note with satisfaction that you have agreed to participate in a Summit meeting of the Four Powers in Paris which Prime Minister Macmillan, President de Gaulle and myself proposed to you. I can wall understand the difficulty of arriving at a date commonly acceptable to the four of us.\n\nI have been in touch with Prune Minister Macmillan and President de Gaulle in regard to the alternative dates which you suggest. Unfortunately, due to other engagements, both President de Gaulle and I would not find it possible to meet on April 21. I further understand that Prime Minister Macmillan has prior commitments which run from May 3 until mid-May.\n\nProvided that this is acceptable to you, the best arrangement would seem to be for the meeting of the Four Powers to open in Paris on May 16.\n\nI trust, Mr. Chairman, that this will not present any difficulties to you and that we may agree to meet in Paris on that date. Sincerely,\n\nDWIGHT D. EISENHOWER",
