    "text": "To the Congress of the United States: I am pleased to submit to the Congress the Twenty-Sixth Annual Report of the National Science Foundation, covering fiscal year 1976. This Report covers events prior to the beginning of my Administration.\n\nThe growth of scientific knowledge and its use in the service of mankind is an important concern of our times. The strength of our Nation depends in large part on the ideas and technologies that have emerged from our pursuit of questions at the frontiers of science. We must continue to invest in the development of fundamental knowledge to help meet the challenges and opportunities of the future. My 1978 Budget, now before the Congress, reflects the high order of importance this Administration gives to basic scientific research.\n\nWe are aware that the technological advances which result from scientific inquiry represent a mixed blessing, often creating strains upon the environment, our natural resources, and our ability to wisely manage progress. The remedy is not to retreat from new knowledge but to progress further in our understanding of the processes that underlie our universe, drawing upon the inventiveness of our people and keeping alive the political freedom that guarantees our scientists the right of free and open intellectual inquiry.\n\nThis annual Report of the National Science Foundation expresses in concrete terms the achievements of scientists and engineers supported by the Foundation's programs during the past fiscal year.\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House, August 15, 1977.",
