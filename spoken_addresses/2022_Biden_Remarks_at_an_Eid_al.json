    "text": "The President. Thank you, Doc. Thank you.\n\nMom, with your permission, you boys can come up on stage if you want.\n\nAudience members . Aww!\n\nThe President. Come on. Don't worry, he's coming. \n\n \n\nWhat's your name? And what's your name? Great to see you. Okay, good.\n\nWell, welcome to the White House, guys. Welcome to the White House. And Eid Mubarak.\n\nAudience members . Eid Mubarak!\n\nThe President. I'm honored to welcome Representatives Tlaib and Carson. I think they're here. I see a hand going up back there. All right. And although she can't be here today, I also enjoyed seeing Representative Omar over the weekend.\n\nAnd look, welcome to the members of the diplomatic corps and to the elected representatives and community leaders all across the country, the thinkers, and activists. And it's great to have you here in the White House, all working to make our Nation and our world stronger and more inclusive. I emphasize \"inclusive.\"\n\nAnd if you'll excuse a point of personal privilege, I want to\u2014is Madinah Wilson-Anton here?\n\nDelaware State Representative Madinah Wilson-Anton . Yes, I'm here. \n\nThe President. Welcome. It's good to see you. She represents the State of Delaware, by the way. And I want you to know she works at the University of Delaware, at the Biden Institute. So we call that \"using a point of personal privilege.\" [ Laughter ] And there have not been many Senators from Delaware. It's a small State. As a matter of fact, there's never been one. And so I want to take advantage of it by making sure I introduce her.\n\nJill and I are so glad to host all of you on this joyous occasion. You know, we send our warmest greetings celebrating Eid all across the United States and, quite frankly, around the world.\n\nOne of the promises I made when I ran for office is that I was to restore this annual celebration, because it's important. It's important. Sadly\u2014sadly, last year, because of the pandemic, we had to hold a virtual event. This year, thanks to the progress we've made fighting the pandemic, we can fully honor my promise.\n\nAnd it's in no small part thanks to the courage and commitment of many Muslim frontline workers and first responders, many of them. Many. And to the brilliant Muslim scientists who helped pioneer the technology for COVID-19 vaccine\u2014don't forget that either. Not only helping people here, but people around the world.\n\nAt the same time, we know that it's a bittersweet day for many\u2014too many families. You know, even as we celebrate Eid and mark the end of the holy month of Ramadan, we also, in our hearts, have those families who lost a loved one to the pandemic.\n\nAnd by the way, I was telling the doc: You know, there's a lot of similarities between all the three major religions here. But I want you to know you have a slight advantage in Ramadan. For Lent, I've got to go 40 days. [ Laughter ] Forty days with no sweets and no ice cream. [ Laughter ] And I did it. Forty. [ Laughter ] It's harder, guys. You know what I mean? \n\nAnyway, throughout the past month, Muslims have fasted each day from dawn to dusk. And while\u2014you know, while exercising the patience of discipline can be a solitary act, it also is something that strengthens community bonds. It helps communities stick together. Communities are\u2014is essential\u2014essential to the celebration of Ramadan and Eid.\n\nYou know, whether breaking your fast with friends or family, or joining neighbors in acts of volunteering, or gathering for nightly communal prayers special to the month of Ramadan, this is a time to reflect not just on oneself and one's faith, but on the entire community, a whole community.\n\nYou know, through their fast, Muslims demonstrate empathy for suffering of others, strengthening and renewing their resolve to give generously and to make the world a better place, better for all who suffer. And I mean that sincerely. I've witnessed it around the world.\n\nThis year, for the first time in decades, three Abrahamic faiths all celebrate their holy days at the same time. Think about that. The same time. That's a message, guys. No, I really mean that. I think\u2014I really believe it. Ramadan. Passover. Easter. And each a time of celebration for the light that has triumphed over darkness and for death giving way to renewal of life.\n\nYou know, each of us remember the work that remains to be unfinished here on Earth\u2014and there's a lot of it\u2014to which God calls all his children. You know, that we should strive to show kindness and mercy, understanding to one another. And that we should do unto others as we wish to have done\u2014do unto us. Sound familiar? Sound familiar in every language. It's similar.\n\nToday we celebrate the incredible stories of the indispensable contributions of Muslims all across this great Nation. Muslim Americans, a diverse and vibrant part of the United States, making invaluable cultural and economic contributions to communities all across the Nation.\n\nYou know what I think it's about? I think you understand the sense of empathy. How can you move without empathy to understand? Teachers, counselors, mentors helping young people achieve their full potential.\n\nBy the way, I don't know which one of you guys is going to be President, but you know\u2014[ laughter ]\u2014if I were you, I'd be Secretary of State. Anyway, all kidding aside, look at these young men. They can be anything they want in this country, if we're smart. Anything. Anything at all.\n\nAnd members of the military, first responders serving with such distinction, keeping us safe at home and abroad. Public servants across this country and across the administration who are leading the work to address the challenges of our time.\n\nI've said it from the beginning that my administration\u2014and I meant it, and I proved it\u2014is going to look like America\u2014look like America\u2014really\u2014with Muslim Americans serving at every level. And it does. Muslim Americans in my administration have key roles in tackling the climate crisis, rebuilding our economy, safeguarding our health, restoring our alliances, and so much more.\n\nAnd I'm incredibly proud to have nominated the first Muslim American ever confirmed to the Federal bench. And I've appointed the first Muslim to serve as Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom.\n\nAnd it's especially important because today, around the world, we're seeing so many Muslims being targeted with violence. No one\u2014no one should discriminate against oppressed\u2014or be oppressed for their religious beliefs. Nobody. Nobody.\n\nSo today we also remember all those who are not able to celebrate this holy day, including Muslim and\u2014excuse me\u2014and including Uyghurs and Rohingyas and all\u2014all those who are facing famine, violence, conflict, and disease.\n\nAnd we honor\u2014we honor\u2014the signs of hope and progress toward the world we want to see, including the cease-fire, which allowed the people in Yemen to honor Ramadan and celebrate Eid in peace for the first time in 6 years.\n\nBut at the same time, we have to acknowledge that an awful lot of work remains to be done abroad and here at home. Muslims make our Nation stronger every single day, even as they still face real challenges and threats in our society, including targeted violence and Islamophobia that exists. I mean, it's just astounding. And\u2014well, I won't go into it. Anyway\u2014 \u2014I won't get\u2014making our Nation more equitable, more inclusive for Muslim Americans is an essential part of the enduring work to form the more perfect Union. That's what we seek.\n\nYou know, we're the only nation in all the history of the world that's been organized not based on a religion, race, ethnicity, geography, but on an idea. Think about that. An idea. \"We hold these truths to be self-evident,\" that all men and women are created equal \"endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights,\" life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness\u2014et cetera.\n\nWe've never met that goal, but we've never walked away from it\u2014except one brief moment\u2014and we're back. And we're back and making\u2014 . No, I really mean it.\n\nAnd the resilience of Muslim Americans enriching the fabric of this Nation is testament to Quran's teaching: We have made you into nations and tribes so that you may know one another. The last part: So you may know one another.\n\nOur differences should not be obstacles that divide us, but opportunities to learn from one another. You know, it was mentioned earlier\u2014excuse the diversion here\u2014but when I became chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee\u2014I'm a\u2014if you come to my home, in my library you'll see a lot of contemporary theology and comparative theology. And I'm just\u2014been interested in it my whole career.\n\nAnd I realized how little I knew about the details of Islam. I knew\u2014I knew about it, but I didn't know the difference that existed. I didn't know what the hidden Imam\u2014I mean, I\u2014so I went out and I hired a full professor\u2014a professor of Islamic studies who came to work with me. He thought he was only staying a year. Every Wednesday, he had lunch with me. And he said, \"How much more do you need to know?\" \n\nBut all kidding aside\u2014I really mean it\u2014I really mean it\u2014it was a chance to seek out and build and celebrate a common community. So let's celebrate today as we move forward this year, holding this teaching in our heart.\n\nI am so proud to serve this community as your President, and I'm humbled by the amazing accomplishments reflected in this room in front of me. And I'm grateful to have this opportunity to join together today to renew our common commitment to shared values.\n\nThank you. And God bless you, may God bless America, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.",
