    "text": "The President. Well, Mr. President\u2014Barack\u2014I have to tell you: Every time I hear a dial tone, I think of Harry. You all think I'm kidding? I'm not.\n\nJill and I are here for Harry, but he\u2014if he would\u2014he wouldn't want us to really be here for just him, as everybody has referenced. Landra, we're here for you and for the family. Eulogies are for the living.\n\nYou know it's a true love story when you're still talking about your first date 60 years later, Gov. Harry never tired of telling of the time you two kids had to push-start his car, making your way down the road with wide smiles on your face. My recollection is, he called it, when he told me the story, one of those, quote, \"moments that turn a life and that stay with you until the last breath.\" Landra, what a life you turned together until his last breath.\n\nTo Lana and Rory and Leif, Josh, Key, all the grandchildren, great-grandchildren: Seeing and hearing you talk about him today, it's clear. My dad used to have an expression. He'd say you are blood of his blood, bone of his bone. You are the product of Harry and Landra Reid. What a gift. What a gift God gave you. What a gift that was and is.\n\nElder Ballard; President Obama; Vice President Harris; Second Gentleman; Governor Sisolak, thanks for the passport into the State; and Iris and Chuck Schumer; and Paul and Nancy Pelosi; Members of the Nevada congressional delegation; Senator Cortez Masto and Rosen; and Representatives\u2014excuse me\u2014Horsford and Lee and Titus; Members of Congress\u2014Democrat and Republican, past and present; and distinguished guests: What a gift Harry Reid was to this State and to this Nation and to so many of us individually.\n\nI know he's smiling right now. Only Harry Reid, at his sendoff, would sandwich a speaker between a former President of the United States, Carole King, and the Killers. [ Laughter ] Thanks, Harry. [ Laughter ] You've always had a great sense of humor. You always had to win, and you always did. He got me again, but he always got me.\n\nThe first time I met Harry, I got a call asking whether as\u2014I had just been elected, at 29 years old, to the United States Senate; I hadn't even turned 32 yet. He was a newly\u2014I was a newly elected Senator. And he asked me to campaign for his election for Nevada's Senate seat being vacated by a man I'd only just begun to know, Alan Bible.\n\nThe first thing when he met\u2014when I met him in Nevada, we were talking about where he's from, and he said, \"Well, I used to have a go out and shoot mad dogs.\" And I thought, \"What in the hell am I doing here?\" [ Laughter ] I swear to God. \"I used to go out and shoot mad dogs.\" And I'm thinking: \"Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. What's going on?\" \n\nHarry lost that general election by less than 600 votes to Paul Laxalt. And he never let me forget thinking that I'd probably cost him those 600 votes. I'm only kidding about that piece, but I probably did.\n\nBut when he asked me to come back and campaign for him when he ran for the House in 1982, he won that time, and then he won in '86. And we'd go on to serve in Congress together for more than 30 years. We worked together with Barack during the 8 years we were in office.\n\nAnd even when Harry was done in the Senate, he was never really done, as all of you from Nevada know. He'd ask me to campaign for an awful lot of Nevada Democrats, many of whom are here today. I could never say no, although you probably said, \"Oh, God, he invited Biden into my district?\"\n\nBut I talked to him often during this last election, taking his advice\u2014and Landra can tell you\u2014of coming to his home on more than one occasion to visit and get his advice and where I should be going in order to win.\n\nAfter we won, one of the things that Harry did\u2014which was sort of incongruous with Harry, as you've heard today\u2014he sent me a text. I've saved it. He said: \"I'm so proud. Joe, you're my brother. We won.\" Well, it made a big deal to me\u2014it was a big deal to me that he felt that way. I know Harry never wrote what he didn't believe. It made me feel good.\n\nAnd he gave me a sense of confidence. It felt like he was my brother. I counted on him. And I know so many of you felt that same way about Harry as well throughout his career and your great relationship with him.\n\nOver five decades, we became genuine friends: the Irish Catholic kid from Scranton, Pennsylvania, and the Latter-day Saint from Searchlight. You think I'm kidding? Harry was like the guys I grew up with back in Scranton and in Claymont, Delaware. Harry would always have your back like the guys I grew up with. Harry had mine, and he knew I had his.\n\nAlthough, I sometimes wondered, when I was trying to make an important point to Harry, about whether he really did have my back as he hung up. But to tell you the truth, every time\u2014every time he would do it, I knew it was real\u2014the real Harry. It was him.\n\nHe had all he needed. He didn't want any more or need any more. And we did share some similarities. As Barack said, we have loving families, wives that are smarter and better looking than we were. And Harry and I both liked to talk a lot. I'm just testing whether you're asleep yet. \n\nBut whether you served with Harry for decades or you were new to America just a few days ago, you wanted Harry in your corner. And that's not hyperbole.\n\nHis toughness was distinctively Nevadan. His story was unmistakably American. His remarkable journey has been told so many\u2014by so many because it has been traveled by so few. The desert shack he called home. The miles he hitchhiked to school. A boxing ring where he always got up. The family tragedies he endured. The cancer he and Landra fought. The halls of power he walked. The State he transformed. The country he shaped. He was proof that there is nothing ordinary about America.\n\nOrdinary Americans can do anything given half a chance. \"We, the People\" are pretty damn extraordinary. America is an idea. An idea that anybody, given a shot, can reach their potential.\n\nHarry was extraordinary though. He and I grew up on different sides of the country, but we came from the same place, where certain values ran deep: first, loyalty, faith, resolve, service, your word. It was pounded into my head from the time I was child: \"Joey, you're a man. You either have your word\u2014without your word, you're not a man.\" And he met the marker for what I always believed was the most important thing which you can measure a person by: their actions and keeping their word.\n\nIf Harry said he was going to do something, he did it. He didn't do what the modern-day rationale is: \"When I told you I would do that, I didn't realize that this would happen.\" No matter what happened, if he gave you his word, he kept it. You could bank on it.\n\nThat's how he got so much done for the good of the country for so many decades. That's how he literally saved\u2014we forget it\u2014Social Security during the Bush years; stopped Yucca Mountain from becoming a nuclear waste site; secured the votes for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIt's how he helped us rein in Wall Street\u2014the excesses\u2014and repealed \"don't ask, don't tell.\" It's how he created Nevada's first national park and conserved Lake Tahoe. And how he was always championed Native Americans and Tribal communities and so much more.\n\nNone of it was easy. Not a lot of it was particularly popular when he was doing it. That's the thing about Harry: He never gave up. He never gave up. He never gave up on anybody he cared about.\n\nLike every great leader, he led the Democratic Caucus just\u2014not by speaking, but by listening, by hearing all points of view and finding a common ground.\n\nHarry cared so much about his fellow Americans and so little about what anybody thought of him. He was all Searchlight, no spotlight.\n\nI always appreciate the private comfort\u2014and so does Jill, who is with me tonight\u2014that he offered me and Jill in difficult moments in our lives. We know we're not the only ones.\n\nSince his passing, we've all heard those wonderful tributes. The gracious way he would console grieving\u2014the grieving and encourage someone living with a disability. I still have that picture of our buddy Max Baucus ,* Max losing three of his limbs. He's\u2014Harry is standing in front of him in the wheelchair, holding his cheeks. And you know Max knew\u2014Max knew Harry cared about him.\n\nThe generous way he would empower a new colleague or insist that the new moms and dads on his staff would put their family first, even before their jobs, and do it always. And the genuine friendships he made with the Capitol Police have been recognized three times, because he was one of them\u2014he wore the uniform.\n\nTo a friend in need, Harry's voice was soft and gentle. In praise of himself, he was stone-cold silent. In the pursuit of fairness and prosperity, his voice would echo and will echo for generations in this State.\n\nLook, let there be no doubt: Harry Reid will be considered one of the greatest Senate Majority Leaders in history. I've served longer than all but about 12 United States Senators\u2014served there for over 36 years. I've had the honor of serving with a few names of those names to be on that shortlist.\n\nFor Harry, it wasn't about power; it was about the sake of power, about the power to be able to use power to do right by people. That's why you wanted Harry in your corner, and that's what we should remember as a nation today. Harry knew better than most how difficult democracy is, that the idea of America itself is under attack from dark and deepening forces, that we're in a battle for the soul of America.\n\nLandra, I remember sitting in a room with Harry when he was supporting me for President and my explaining to him the reason I decided to run when I had decided I was never going to do that again was watching all those neo-Nazis come out of the fields down in Virginia, chanting anti-Semitic bile, carrying Nazi flags. And he asked me, \"What?\" I said, \"We have to restore the soul of America.\"\n\nNo one knew it better than Harry: Protecting democracy requires vigilant stewardship. Harry's life shows that for all\u2014from our darkest days, we can find light and find hope.\n\nJust look at his life: In just about every respect, Harry Reid came into this world with the odds against him. He believed life\u2014and he lived it, and he left it believing anything was possible. He has demonstrated that anything is possible. Look at this incredible family.\n\nHarry, in a small way, reminds me of my dad. My dad used to say, \"Joey, never explain and never complain.\" I remember one day we were having an event when I was running for my, I guess, it was fifth term. We were at my house. I was feeling a little sorry for myself, talking about a family\u2014loss of a daughter. My dad said, \"I'll be back in a minute.\"\n\nHe left the house\u2014we were waiting for people to show up\u2014went up to the local Hallmark store and came back with a cartoon that was a little brass plaque with two sections to it. There were two clips from the cartoon character H\u00e4gar the Horrible.\n\nAnd in one, H\u00e4gar the Viking, on his ship, had been moving along near the rocks, lightning comes out of the sky, charged his horns of his helmet, breaks the mast of his ship. And he's looking up at God, and he's going, \"God, why me?\" In the next frame is a picture with H\u00e4gar and the ship and a voice coming down from Heaven saying, \"Why not?\"\n\nThat was my dad: \"What makes you so special these things wouldn't happen to you? Why not? Stand up, get up, never bow, never bend, never yield.\" That was Harry. \"Never complain.\" That's what I admired so much about him.\n\nAbove Harry's desk, as we all know, in his Senate office was a giant portrait of Mark Twain. They both\u2014Harry and Mark Twain\u2014loved Nevada, and they both\u2014they both\u2014knew how to say things we know to be true about ourselves and about our country.\n\nFor Harry, it was this, as he said himself\u2014he said, quote, \"I grew up around people of strong values, even if they rarely talked about them.\" He went on to say, \"They loved their country, worshipped God, never shunned hard work, and never asked for special favors.\"\n\nThat's Harry. That's America. Here is someone Mark Twain himself would have written about as a defining character in America's story had he known Harry.\n\nTo his staff, known as \"Team Reid,\" you've lost an incredibly genuine role model. But we see you carrying on HMR's legacy. The people of Nevada, you lost a beloved son, but his spirit is always going to burn as bright as the desert sun. To the Nation, we lost a giant of America, a plainspoken, honorable, decent, brave, unyielding man.\n\nMay this be his legacy: to call on each of us to be our best, to speak truth from the heart, to take up the remaining rounds of Harry Reid's good fight for the America we all love. What a gift. I mean this from the bottom of my heart. What a gift. What a life of a nation that he turned until his last breath.\n\nLandra, God bless you, God bless the entire family, God bless my friend Harry\u2014a great American\u2014and God protect our troops.",
