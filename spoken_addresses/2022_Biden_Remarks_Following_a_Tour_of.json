    "text": "The President. Hey, folks. We're about to pick the basketball teams right now, so\u2014 . I get first pick.\n\nHey, first of all, I want to thank the team behind me\u2014the Governor; Lieutenant Governor; the two Senators, who've been friends for a long time; as well as Joe Neguse, Congressman; and your mayor and the sheriff as well.\n\nFolks, Jill and I and my team have surveyed the damage of the Marshall Fire, and it's as devastating as it looks on television, and it's devastating\u2014as devastating as the many environmental crises I've seen in the last year, in 2021. You know, we've had over $99 billion in loss in the last little over a year.\n\nAnd you know, there's nothing so frightening, in my view, as a fire. More land has burned in the United States, from California up into the\u2014Idaho, and here in Colorado, and parts of the South that\u2014than make up the entire\u2014if they're\u2014in terms of total acreage, as the entire State of New Jersey, had it burned to the ground. Every single, solitary square acre in New Jersey, that's how much has burned.\n\nAnd I can't imagine what it's like to be here in this neighborhood and see winds whipping up to a hundred miles an hour and see flames approaching. Fire, I think, is the most frightening of all dilemmas.\n\nAnd you know, 6,000 acres wiped out here, over a thousand structures. But you know what I've\u2014Jill and I have noticed\u2014what we've noticed in other places: the incredible courage and resolve that you all show. We got a chance to meet with scores of families in the neighborhoods across the street, many of which homes you lived in. And it just is really amazing to see the courage.\n\nAnd you know, there's a couple of police officers, including standing behind me, that, in fact, when the fire started, they were called in\u2014they lost their homes, but they were out helping other people while their homes were burning.\n\nIt's a measure of, I think, who we are as a country. Homes and businesses destroyed\u2014both a home and a business destroyed at one of the tables we just met; I don't want to embarrass anyone. But at least, you know\u2014and one life lost that we're aware of.\n\nAnd we just walked the streets of Louisville. And a whole neighborhood, gone. It's\u2014but people here and across Boulder County are stepping up for one another. They're stepping up. I've heard stories from some of you who have lost your homes about how people have reached out, what they've done, and what more needs to be done.\n\nBut you know, as you know better than I do, there's parts of this county where people can't drink the water. Local businesses\u2014so local businesses are stepping up and donating water\u2014bottled water. First responders have come to Boulder County from hundreds of miles away to pitch in.\n\nAnd a water treatment plant was in the path of the fire and\u2014but one worker there, a man named Greg, barely\u2014barely and bravely ventured back into the plant, risking his life, for a simple reason. He manually turned the valves to ensure that there was enough water pressure to\u2014for the firefighters to be able to do their job. I mean, people do extraordinary things in extraordinary times.\n\nEarlier today I met with those firefighters and a number of the first responders. And you know, there's an old expression: God made man, then he made a few firefighters. And there's some truth to that.\n\nI was telling a couple of the law enforcement officers and firefighters that I was raised in a little town\u2014after we moved from Scranton, Pennsylvania\u2014called Claymont, Delaware. Went to a school\u2014grade school and high school\u2014across the street from the Claymont Fire Department. And I\u2014growing up in my neighborhood, the kids from Brookview Apartments\u2014you either became a cop, a firefighter, or a priest. I wasn't qualified for any, so I became a President. \n\nBut all kidding aside, you know, it's amazing\u2014amazing\u2014what people do in crises. And my message to them and everyone impacted by this is that, you know, not only are you helping each other, but we're here with you. We're not going to go away. We're not\u2014the Federal Government's not going to go away. The Governor has been an incredible partner. Matter of fact, that probably drove him crazy\u2014 \u2014how many times I called him even before he called me, saying, \"What do you need?\"\n\nBut we're, you know, declaring a national disaster area. We're going to do everything we possibly can. The head of FEMA is with me today. She has run this show in a way, I think, most people who've been engaged in disasters would say is remarkable.\n\nBut we're\u2014you know, we're going to make sure that everything you need occurs, including clearing all the debris and putting people in a position to be able to rebuild if their insurance provides for it, additional help if their insurance doesn't, and the kind of help they need in order to get resettled.\n\nBut, folks, a number of you have asked, as we've gone through the tables and met other people in your neighborhood is, \"What do we do now?\" Well, hang on to one another. Hang on to one another. The way you're going to get through this\u2014because we've been through a few things ourselves\u2014is just hanging on to one another. You'll get through this. You will get through this, and you'll be stronger for it.\n\nI know my\u2014I remember when my mother used to say that, and I'd always get angry with her, no matter what it was. This\u2014you know, out of something bad, something good will happen if you look hard enough for it. But hang on to one another. That's the way. You find purpose in what you've been through and what you're going to do.\n\nAnd, folks, look, I intend to do whatever it takes, as long as it takes to support you, your State and local governments, to help you recover and rebuild these communities. The commitment began the day the fire started, December 30, and the Governor asked me for some urgent assistance. And because we had worked earlier, we had gotten a particular satellite in the sky to be able to be focused on you all and see through the smoke and know what was going on.\n\nWell, the truth of the matter is that the commitment began the day the fire started. We immediately mobilized the Federal firefighting equipment, satellite imagery from the Department of Defense, and additional Federal personnel to support the response.\n\nWhen the Governor requested the expanded major disaster declaration, we approved it right away on New Year's Eve. And to help families directly, we surged resource support for temporary housing, home repairs for those who still had homes, and debris removal.\n\nOn Monday, at my request, the FEMA opened the Disaster Assistance Center in Lafayette, the hub to connect families and small businesses directly to what Federal support was available. And we're working closely with Governor Polis to ensure Colorado has every single resource available\u2014every single resource available\u2014to help keep people safe. And I want to thank the Governor and his team\u2014and I mean this sincerely\u2014and the Colorado congressional delegation for their leadership.\n\nWe rode out the\u2014a number of the delegation rode out from Washington with me. And I would say\u2014it's not an exaggeration\u2014that they're mildly proud of their State, mildly proud of their districts. [ Laughter ] If Neguse tells me one more story about how great this particular area is, I'm moving out here. [ Laughter ] I\u2014but\u2014you're laughing, Mayor, but I don't think you want me. When I come, 120 cars come with me, and I don't think you need it. \n\nBut all kidding aside, we really can't thank them enough. And their commitment to you is strong, it's deep, and it's real.\n\nAnd you know, the situation is a blinking code red for our Nation, because the combination of extreme drought\u2014the driest period from June to December ever recorded\u2014ever recorded; unusually high winds; no snow on the ground to start\u2014it created a tinderbox, a literal tinderbox. And even if it was not your backyard, you could feel the ripple effects of what happened.\n\nAnd so, folks, think about when the Grizzly Creek Fire hit Colorado in 2020, helping trigger that massive mudslide\u2014that massive mudslide\u2014that washed out an entire section of I-70, adding hours to people's drives. And you know, we can't ignore the reality that these fires are being supercharged. They're being supercharged by a change in the weather.\n\nNot very far from here, I was\u2014as I was riding out with the Governor, I was saying: \"Gov, this all looks familiar. I've passed over that cemetery. I've passed over that area before.\" It was on my way up to the facility that is one of the most advanced facilities in the country\u2014in not the country, maybe in the world\u2014to find alternatives to fossil fuels.\n\nYou've got\u2014by the way, if you're ever able to see it, we're going to have windmills, you can\u2014that you're going to see that have 100-yard wingspans each\u2014each propeller on that windmill, 100 yards long. So there's so much that is going to be able to be done.\n\nAnd you know, I\u2014when I visited the National Reviewable Lab\u2014Renewable Lab\u2014Energy Lab\u2014about 20 miles\u2014I said\u2014from here\u2014it's also going to create a significant number of jobs.\n\nThe reason I'm telling you this is that's no solace that you lost your home now, but it's that we're going to be able to do a lot of renewable things that allow you to not only rebuild, but afford to rebuild and rebuild better, to build back better than it was before. And it includes billions of dollars for wildfire preparedness, resilience, and response to protect homes and public resources.\n\nAnd, folks, there's going to be a lot of good jobs we can create. And there's going to\u2014we're going to do\u2014by acting boldly.\n\nYou know, but the bottom line here is, we have to summon the courage to do something about it, to build back better as one Nation. And I got a\u2014recovery here in Boulder County is going to take a long time; I'm not going to kid you. But we're going to stay with you as long as it takes. We're going to be here for every step of the way, I promise. And it's going to be better. It's going to be better.\n\nSo we're going to get through this together. It's easy for us to say. Jill and I have not gone through what you've gone through, but we have had lightning strike our home and almost lose our home. And we only lost about 25 percent of it; we were able to rebuild.\n\nBut you know, the hard part is the thing\u2014the memorabilia you lost, the special things that you had put away that you lost. But you know, look at it this way: You've got a lot more special dreams to make, and they're going to be in your new home.\n\nSo thank you, thank you, thank you.\n\nThe First Lady. Can I say something too?\n\nThe President. Of course you can. The boss is going to say something to you all. \n\nThe First Lady. I just wanted\u2014after seeing the devastation that we just saw in the community we just visited, I too would like to thank the firefighters and the police and the EMTs and the rescue and recovery teams for doing such a great job for this community.\n\nAnd you know, I can tell\u2014as we've met so many people as we walked through the neighborhood, as we talked to all of you\u2014what a warm, strong community you are.\n\nAnd I'd like to say, on a personal note\u2014the Governor told me how many of you lost your family pet. And you know, they're members of the family too. So I want to just say how terribly sorry we are for the loss of your pets. Because we're animal people. So, you know, we know what a tough loss that is.\n\nSo we know you're strong. You will rebuild, and we're going to help. So thanks for inviting us here. And take care of one another. Thank you.\n\nThe President. And by the way, I hope you'll invite us back.\n\nThank you so very, very much. And thank the team behind me from the group that's out here to\u2014it's represented you so well.\n\nAnd by the way, the whole Nation's thinking about you. You have no idea how many prayers\u2014how many people's prayers you're in; when I went to Mass, how many people were praying for you all. Because they saw it. They saw it on television, and they could hardly imagine it happening.\n\nBut every time I'd walk out of my grandpop's house up in Scranton, he'd say, \"Joey, keep the faith.\" My grandmother would go, \"No, Joey, spread it.\" Let's spread the faith and get it done.\n\nThank you all so much.",
