And we're really starting to move here.\n\nAnd the Vice President, thank you\u2014\u2014\n\nVice President Kamala D. Harris. Of course.\n\nThe President. \u2014\u2014for your focus on small business.\n\nWe're pushing lenders to raise their game and provide more help to small\u2014many small businesses. As you know, particularly Hispanic, as well as African American small businesses are just out of business because they got bypassed the first time around.\n\nToday I'm proud to sign the extension, which I'm going to do in a second, of the Paycheck Protection Program. It is a bipartisan accomplishment.\n\nNearly 90,000 business owners are still in line, and there's money left. Without somebody signing this bill today, there are hundreds of thousands of people who could lose their jobs, and small and family businesses that might close forever. And, as you know, small business is the backbone of our economy, representing almost 50 percent of all the employees in America.\n\nAnd I want to thank Senators Cardin, Shaheen, Rubio, and Collins for their work in the Senate\u2014it was a bipartisan effort\u2014and Young Kim and Velazquez, as well as Luetkemeyer for their work in the House to make sure this happened.\n\nAnd, the last 2 months, we've approved forgivable loans for three-thousand\u2014excuse me, three-million-six-hundred small businesses\u2014six-hundred-thousand small businesses. And three-million-three-hundred * of those small businesses were less than\u2014higher\u2014had fewer than 20 employees, which is the backbone of most of the communities.\n\nSo, with that, I'm going to sign this. And thank you all for coming.\n\n \n\nThanks, folks. Enjoy yourselves.",
