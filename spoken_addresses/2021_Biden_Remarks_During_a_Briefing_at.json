    "text": "The President. You know, one of the things that caught my attention\u2014I think we talked about this very early on, within the first 6 weeks of the virus becoming where it\u2014everybody, and people starting to get sick, and some of them die. And\u2014was I got a call from a mayor, a really great guy, a real hard-working fellow in Detroit, saying to me, \"Mr. President, you don't understand.\" This was even before\u2014I wasn't President then, actually. He called me, \"Mr. Vice President.\" He said: \"You know, it's\u2014I don't think people understand. You know, my community is now about 80 percent African American. And we're dying and getting sick at a much higher rate than the White community here or any other community.\"\n\nAnd I brought that up, initially, before I put together that group that you're leading and helping lead, and no one wanted to hear it. And I remember they\u2014we had trouble getting your predecessors just to track it. But what you're doing really makes a difference. It makes a gigantic difference. As the Vice President knows as well or better than anybody, it really, really makes a difference. So thank you.\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Response Chief Health Equity Officer Leandris Liburd . Thank you.\n\nVice President Kamala D. Harris. Thank you.\n\nChief Health Equity Officer Liburd . Dr. Walensky. Thank you so much.\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle P. Walensky . Any other questions for us?\n\nThe President. No, but why are you all standing? \n\nThat's the first one. You don't have to stand for us. Why don't you sit down? For real. Get comfortable.\n\nVice President Harris . No chair.\n\nThe President. No, they have chairs.\n\nParticipant . We do it all the time, sir.\n\nThe President. They have chairs. But you know, that's the first question.\n\nAnd the second question is, why did only one person clap? I don't know. They might take that to say\u2014you know what I mean? I'm teasing. I'm teasing.\n\nThe reason I do this, as the doc knows\u2014 \u2014you all are too serious here\u2014we owe you a gigantic debt of gratitude, and we will for a long, long, long time, because I hope this is the beginning of the end of not paying attention to what's going to come again and again and again and again.\n\nWe can build all the walls we want. We can have the most powerful armies in the world, we can\u2014but we cannot stop\u2014we cannot stop these viruses, other than be aware of where they are and move quickly on them when we find them.\n\nAnd the one thing that I\u2014the reason I am so, so happy to have been able to\u2014anyway\u2014to have Doc here is that science is back. No, all kidding aside. Think about it: For the longest time, not just as it relates to CDC, but science was viewed as sort of an appendage to anything else we were talking about. But it's back.\n\nParticipant. That's right.\n\nThe President. And I just want you to have some confidence that it's not only\u2014are the Vice President and I and the whole team, and the whole COVID team writ large committed, but the American people have moved. The American people have moved. This is a bipartisan effort now. Now, it isn't showing itself in the way Senators and Congressmen vote, but the public\u2014the public. We were talking about it on a helicopter\u2014on the airplane.\n\nVice President Harris. Yes, yes.\n\nThe President. The public in a bipartisan way.\n\nWhen I came up with this $1.9 billion for this whole COVID\u2014and the economic relief side of it as well\u2014we were told that it could never pass; we'd never get any help. Well, we didn't get any help in the Senate or the House, but you have 55 percent of the Republicans in America supporting it. You have 90-some percent of the Democrats, 80-some\u2014the point is, the public is thankful to you, because it's about science. That's what they understand. They understand.\n\nAnd we're not going back to the old days. Even if tomorrow the whole administration changed, I think things have\u2014you've changed things. You've changed them in a way that are going to make everybody healthier in this country. And when we have a crisis, you're prepared to meet it, because you speak truth and science to power, and that is the power.\n\nSo, to all of the folks listening\u2014I guess you said there's hundreds or if not thousands of people listening.\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Response Incident Manager Henry Walke . Thousands. Yes.\n\nThe President. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\n\nThere's an entire generation coming up that is learning from what you've done. I don't just mean learning about how to deal with a virus. Learning about it makes a difference to tell the truth, to follow the science, and just wherever it takes you, and just be honest about it. And that's what you've all done.\n\nSo we owe you a debt of gratitude in all the lives you've saved. I carry in my pocket\u2014and the doc knows\u2014on the back of my schedule, I have listed every single day with the exact number of people who have died from COVID the day before. I mean for cumulative. We're at 535,217 dead as of yesterday, last night.\n\nIt's got to stop. But you're slowing it. It's stopping.\n\nAnd it really, really matters. You know, that's more people than have died in all of World War\u2014Americans\u2014all of World War I, World War II, the Vietnam war, and 9/11 combined\u2014combined\u2014in a year. In a year.\n\nAnd you are the Army. You're the Navy. You're the Marines. You're the Coast Guard. I really mean it. This is a war. And you are the frontline troops. It sounds silly to say it that way. It sounds sort of grand. But think about it.\n\nAnd finally, we got the vaccines. We got the companies together. And then, they didn't have the wherewithal to be able to produce all the vaccines. So there's a thing called the Defense Production Act. As President, I'm allowed to enforce it. So I had people saying, \"Stop making that, and start making these.\" We finally put together\u2014did you ever think you'd see the day\u2014because you've all been involved with medicine\u2014see two major drug companies cooperate for the good of the country? One invents\u2014one comes up with the drug, and the other says, \"Well, we'll manufacture it for you\"?\n\nSo what you're doing really, really, really matters, not only\u2014and I'll end with this\u2014not only in saving lives, but changing the mindset of the country. Changing the mindset of the country. And it's affected everything, not just affected people's health. It's affected their attitude: the attitude about what we can do as a country.\n\nEverybody thought that I was\u2014I didn't quite understand when I announced that we were going to\u2014we had over 100 million shots in less than\u2014you remember when I said we're going to\u2014my goal was to have 100 million shots in people's arms in the first 100 days as President? And everybody said, \"Oh, that sounds\u2014yes, right.\" Now it's, \"He should have been more\u2014have been, you know\"\u2014 . \"Why didn't they say more?\" You know what I mean?\n\nBut here's the point: The point is that it is changing the way we look at a whole range of things. And when I announced it, everybody but the Vice President wondered why I also pointed out that we landed a rover on Mars at the same time: Because this is the United States of America, for God's sake. There is nothing, nothing, nothing we cannot do when we do it together. And that's what you're showing everybody.\n\nSo I came to say thank you. I really mean it. I have a whole lot of nice notes on here about the science, but\u2014 \u2014but I came here to say thank you, because you're not only\u2014you're changing the psyche of the country. You're saving lives. You're saving lives. But you're changing the psyche of the country.\n\nAnd this is, as I said\u2014it's not being\u2014I don't think we're being chauvinistic about our country, but this is\u2014think about it: We're the only country in the world that has, every time we've gone into a crisis, have come out stronger immediately after the crisis than when we went in before the crisis. Think about it. It's about who we are.\n\nClosing comment: I was with Xi Jinping in China. I spent more time with him, I'm told, than any world leader because when he was Vice President, I was Vice President. His President and mine wanted us to get to know one another because it was clear he was going to become the President. And I spent\u2014traveled 17,000 miles with him in China, in the United States, and Asia generally, and met with him, I guess, they tell me, 24, 25 hours alone, just me and an interpreter, and he and an interpreter. And by the way, I handed in all my notes. Minor point.\n\nBut all kidding aside, he asked me\u2014we were on the Tibetan Plateau. He asked me and said to me, \"Can you define America for me?\" And I said: \"Yes, in one word. And I mean it\u2014in one word: possibilities.\" Possibilities. That's what you guys believe in: possibilities, based on science and hard data.\n\nAnd so I just thank you for not only your intellectual skills, but your heart\u2014your heart, your determination. Thank you, thank you, thank you.\n\nAnd I shouldn't have done that because I wanted to yield to my Vice President, who's smarter than I am. \n\nVice President Harris. Well, there's not much to add to that, Mr. President. \n\nThe President. Oh, just sorry.\n\nVice President Harris. No, I\u2014but I will say that I do believe that this administration, with the leadership of our President, is without any question about science. And everyone here knows, before the President was President, he was dedicated to science\u2014the Moonshot, the\u2014and so\u2014and my mother was a scientist. I grew up\u2014the first job I had, little-known fact, was cleaning pipettes at her lab. I was awful. She fired me. \n\nAnd then, there was this moment of global crisis. And the President takes calls with leaders around the world. We talk with people around the world. And they have named their centers of disease control after this center of disease control. They put their\u2014the name of their country, and they call it \"CDC.\"\n\nParticipant . That's right.\n\nVice President Harris. You all are a model for the world around what can be done based on a pursuit of that which will uplift and improve human condition and life. And you guys do this work around the clock.\n\nAnd so we are here to say thank you, because it's not easy. You're making difficult decisions right now, some of the most difficult, but you're making those decisions based on science, based on hard work, and based on a commitment to the public health. And therein lies part of the nobility of your work. You do this work on behalf of people you will never meet, on behalf of people who will never know your names because you care about our country and their well-being.\n\nSo we are here to thank you. Thank you.\n\nThe President . Thank you.",
