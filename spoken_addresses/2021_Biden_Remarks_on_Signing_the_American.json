In the weeks that this bill has been discussed and debated, it's clear that an overwhelming percentage of the American people\u2014Democrats, Independents, our Republican friends\u2014have made it clear\u2014the people out there made it clear they strongly support the American Rescue Plan.\n\nYesterday, with the final passage of the plan in the House of Representatives, their voices were heard and reflected in everything we have in this bill. And I believe this is\u2014and most people, I think, do as well\u2014this historic legislation is about rebuilding the backbone of this country and giving people in this Nation\u2014working people and middle class folks, the people who built the country\u2014a fighting chance. That's what the essence of it is.\n\nAnd I'm going to have a lot more to say about that tonight and in the next couple of days, and be able to take your questions. But in the meantime, what I'm going to do is sign this bill and make the presentation tonight.

And we're going to talk all the elements of the bill, beginning Friday and Saturday and through the week.\n\nSo thank you for being here.\n\n \n\nGot it. Thank you all. Appreciate it.\n\nQ . Mr. President, what's next? What's next after this?",
