    "text": "Well, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I don't know who she's talking about\u2014 \u2014but thank you.\n\nFolks, look, let me say\u2014I hadn't planned on\u2014I didn't know I was going to get that kind of introduction. But let me say at the outset that, you know, we've all gone through really difficult times\u2014every one of you out there\u2014in one way or another. And I had an overwhelming advantage, and I mean it sincerely.\n\nI had a family that was there for me every single, solitary moment. And so I don't deserve this credit for enduring that so many people I meet\u2014think of all the people you know, whether they're constituents or friends or relatives, who get up every morning, don't have anybody\u2014don't have anybody, and they put one foot in front of the other, and they do it. They lost a child, they lost a mother, a father, a husband, someone close to them\u2014just plucked away\u2014and they get up every single day and put one foot in front of the other. And they're the people who deserve our recognition and our credit.\n\nI think I've talked to Bill and Grace Nelson about this: The only thing\u2014today is my son Beau's birthday. But the only thing that Beau said to me when he was\u2014we were told he was\u2014he was going to die within minutes or\u2014if an hour\u2014that he looked at me, and he said: \"Dad, promise me\u2014promise me, Dad, you're going to stay involved.\" I said: \"I'll be involved. I'll be good, Beau.\" He said: \"No, dad, promise me. Give me your word as a Biden that you're going to stay engaged.\"\n\nBecause he knew, like a lot of you\u2014what you've been through\u2014the first instinct is, you just want to curl up in a ball and just leave, no longer do what you've done your whole life that you've\u2014he said, \"Dad\u2014Dad, promise me.\" \"I give my word.\"\n\nAnd that was the last conversation in Walter Reed Hospital, lying there in the bed. And then he looked at me and he said, \"And, Dad\"\u2014and his brother Hunter who was his closest friend. We were all three on the bed. And he turned to me and he said, \"Dad, I want you to know I'm not afraid.\"\n\nSo, you know, I had so much help\u2014so much help\u2014starting from the time that I lost my wife and daughter in an accident. But look, everybody has got horrible things they've had to deal with. And we've watched them\u2014I sat in the Senate for 36 years. We watched people literally die in our midst. I remember that scene where Teddy walked out. Or\u2014I mean, there\u2014so, you know, I'm flattered that you think as highly of me as you stated, Kirsten, but I had\u2014I had a lot of help. I had a lot of help. And I want to thank you for the introduction. It's very gracious. But like I said, there's a lot more people who've done a lot more.\n\nAnd to my good friend Chris Coons\u2014two things I tell everybody about Chris Coons you've got to know: One, he's smarter than you. [ Laughter ] And, two, the boy can preach. He's the only guy that went to law school and got a divinity degree at the same time. I worry about \"divine\" lawyers. But\u2014anyway, Chris, thank you. You've been a great friend.\n\nAnd as\u2014Bryan, as you were speaking, Chuck sort of leaned over; he didn't say anything, but he just like, \"Was that Delaware?\" But it was Delaware. It's why I got involved in politics in the first place.\n\nI remember sitting on\u2014going to a little Catholic grade school in Claymont, Delaware, which was a steel town that was dying. And the bus would go\u2014my mother would drive me to the school parking lot\u2014it was called Holy Rosary School\u2014from a little\u2014and it was called Brookview Apartments. Used to be section 8 housing later.\n\nAnd I get out of the bus\u2014I get out of the car. And this is where I-95 runs parallel to these days. And I said, \"Mom, why are all those kids\"\u2014it was then \"colored.\" \"Why are all those colored kids in that bus?\" Because in Scranton there weren't any\u2014there were very few Blacks. She said, \"They're not allowed to go to school with us here, in Delaware.\" So, you know\u2014and Milton wasn't what you might call the epicenter of desegregation.\n\nAnd so you've been through a lot, but you've done a lot as well. And I thank you.\n\nAnd, Kari\u2014Kari Jobe, you have the voice of an angel, kid. [ Laughter ] I tell you what: You really do. And that guy sitting next to you, he's a lucky guy. [ Laughter ] He's a lucky guy. And besides, he has all his hair. \n\nAnd Vice President Harris, Majority Leader Schumer, Mitch McConnell\u2014and, Mitch, I don't want to hurt your reputation, but we really are friends. And that is not an epiphany we're having here at the moment. We've always\u2014you've always done exactly what you've said. You're a man of word\u2014of your word, and you're a man of honor. Thank you for being my friend.\n\nAnd, folks, Members of Congress and spouses: I'm honored to join you all today.\n\nYou know, we're keeping our prayers for Senator Luj\u00e1n, and keep him in your prayers today. I think, from what I understand, he's going to be okay and be back with us in the not-too-distant future. But we pray for a safe recovery.\n\nAnd a special thank you to the bipartisan chairs of this breakfast: Representative Lamb and Walberg, * Gillibrand and Rounds. Mike, I know it's been 3 months to this day that you lost Jean to cancer. So, you know\u2014you know of which I speak. And it's like losing a piece of your soul. And I\u2014you know, I\u2014I remember.\n\nToday, as I said, is a day that a lot of us can remember the times when we lost\u2014each of us. And just like I miss my son every single day, I\u2014there's\u2014I know he's always with me, for real. He's always with me.\n\nCongresswoman McBath, just like your precious son Jordan\u2014he's always going to be with you, for real. It becomes a piece of you. You know, how many times did you all been through this, about to make a decision and say, \"What would Beau want?\" Or \"What would Jill want?\" Or \"What would\"\u2014you know, whatever it is. So it's\u2014you know.\n\nAnd for everyone out there who has lost a piece of their soul, they're always with you. And all through the pain, I think you\u2014if you can find purpose, find purpose. Purpose of a life that makes you worthy in their eyes and what they expect of you.\n\nThis breakfast usually is held in a big Washington hotel with a big crowd. Today we're here in the Visitor Center of the United States Capitol with a much smaller crowd, a more intimate setting, to see each other here and listen to each other\u2014standing in this, which is, in Governmental terms, a \"sacred place.\"\n\nI thank our\u2014I think about our former colleagues and close friends we lost in this year: Bob Dole; Harry Reid; Johnny Isakson, who was a hell of guy; Max Cleland; Carl Levin; Mike Enzi; John Warner; and Walter Mondale. And you know, I learned a long time ago: Never make one good eulogy. Because if you make one good eulogy, you've got to do a lot of eulogies. But I've had the pleasure of knowing their families. And there's a lot of good friends, both sides of the aisle, who disagreed on many, many things, who still talked and listened to one another.\n\nI think I've said to Mitch and some of you earlier, in the last couple of years, that, you know, one of the things I don't know for sure, but I think is missing in the Congress is, we don't spend as much time with one another as we used to. We used to eat lunch together. I mean, literally sit down\u2014not in the Senate Dining Room of the Senate or that small dining room off to the\u2014right across the hall from the visitors dining room, and there were those two big round tables\u2014big\u2014big dining room tables and a buffet.\n\nAnd I remember when I first got here, after my wife and daughter were killed in an accident, my boys were still in the hospital\u2014and I remember Teddy would always come and say, \"Come to lunch.\" I didn't want any part of going to lunch. And one day, he just dragged me over to lunch. And he said, \"You'll learn more there than anyplace else.\"\n\nAnd I would go to lunch there, literally every day, and listen to the senior members. And you learn about their losses, their happiness. You learn about them. You learn about their\u2014you know, I remember one day I walked in and there was a little corner in the table\u2014or a corner table, when the big table was filled. And I sat down. And Jim Eastland said: \"Come over here, Joe. Sit down here.\" And I wasn't about to sit in John Stennis's seat\u2014and because he sat at the head of the table. And he said: \"No, come on. He's gone.\" So I ordered my hamburger or whatever I ordered and took a couple of bites. And in walks John Stennis. And I immediately put a napkin on all my stuff, and I said: \"I'm finished, Mr. Chairman. Come on. Right here.\"\n\nI later got a handwritten letter from him, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon: \"I appreciate the honor of you recognizing my seat, but you didn't finish your meal. I promise this favor will be returned.\" He not only returned, he actually endorsed me when I ran for President from Mississippi. [ Laughter ] And I think\u2014that was an expensive hamburger for him. \n\nBut I guess what I'm trying to say is: You know, when you know one another, when you know\u2014and no matter how badly you disagree\u2014and people think, Rev, that in the days as divided here, we had\u2014we had a lot of flat-out, old segregationists still in our caucus. But Teddy Kennedy would argue like hell with Jim Eastland, and then he'd go down to have lunch. Didn't agree with one another, but they treated each other with respect even in that day.\n\nAnd I just think that, when you learn that another man or woman\u2014and you're flying a codel, and someone has their husband or wife with them, and you learn that they have a kid with a problem with alcoholism, or you learn that they have a daughter who is\u2014has breast cancer. You learn that they have\u2014it's hard to dislike the person.\n\nAnd so one of the things I pray for\u2014and I mean it\u2014is that we sort of get back to the place\u2014and it's so busy; I think things have changed so much\u2014but that we get to really know each other. It's hard to really dislike someone when you know what they're going through is the same thing you're going through.\n\nYou know, like President Eisenhower, the first President to attend this breakfast 70 years ago\u2014at the time, President Eisenhower said\u2014he said, \"There's a need we all have in these days and times for some help which comes from outside ourselves.\" Outside ourselves.\n\nI've attended many of these Prayer Breakfasts over the years\u2014with our Nation at war, in struggle, in strife, peace, in times of prosperity, when everybody was getting on, but a nation in prayer. Jill and I have been humbled by the prayers of so many of you, and it means everything to us. We pray for our Nation as we face an inflection point in our history.\n\nSo much is going to change, no matter who's sitting in my job. The world is changing. The world is changing. I\u2014there's a\u2014the moment\u2014but there's also a moment of great progress, of lives saved in this pandemic, not just the ones lost; new jobs created for people, new hope for rebuilding the Nation, but also a moment of pain for the lost lives and the lives lost in this pandemic. And the cruel twist of fates that occur.\n\nYou know, at a moment of great division of our democracy is at great\u2014grave risk. I pray that we follow what Jesus taught us: To serve rather than be served. I don't always do it. I hope to try. I don't always do it.\n\nI pray to keep the faith. That very promise of America, believing that there's nothing we can't do, where every person is created equal in the image of God, no matter who or where we come from, who we are, or what our color, or how we choose to pray, or whether or not we choose to pray; they deserve to be treated equally throughout their lives.\n\nFaith in the very idea of America that can be defined, in my view, by a single word. I've been saying this for over 30 years. When I get asked to define America, one word: \"Possibilities.\" \"Possibilities.\"\n\nOne of the reasons why other countries sometimes think we're arrogant is, we believe anything is possible. Anything is possible. And faith in the American people will prove each and every day we're a great nation because we're, at our heart, a good people. We do bad things when we get frightened.\n\nSaint Augustine wrote that, \"A people was a multitude defined by a common object of their love.\" I believe the common objects of our love that define us as Americans are opportunity, liberty, dignity, respect, honor, service, truth\u2014things everybody recognizes both here and around the world.\n\nAs I stand in this citadel of democracy that was attacked 1 year ago, the issue is\u2014for us is unity. How do we unite us again? Unity is elusive, but it's really actually necessary. Unity doesn't mean we have to agree on everything. But unity is where enough of us\u2014enough of us\u2014believe in a core of basic things: The common good, the general welfare, a faith in the United States of America\u2014the United States of America.\n\nNearly 3 weeks ago, we were reminded of that truth. A gunman entered a synagogue in Colleyville, Texas. He took four worshippers hostage, including a rabbi, for 11 hours.\n\nBut violence and vengeance didn't pierce the goodness and grace of that scene. Heroic law enforcement officers were joined by local faith leaders, including an imam, a Baptist minister, who offered their help. A nearby Catholic church opened its doors for the hostages' families.\n\nAt sunset, a group of Muslim women\u2014friends of the rabbi's wife\u2014walked in with one of the rabbi's favorite foods. They hugged, and they wept. Because of the bravery of the hostages and the law enforcement officers, the hostages were\u2014escaped safely, and the families were reunited.\n\nWhen asked later if he would change anything, the rabbi said, quote, \"We will do what we always do, which is the best we can.\" \"Which is the best we can.\" I had a long conversation with the rabbi. It was interesting to hear him describe the scene and how faith mattered: Whether you're in a synagogue or a church or a mosque or a temple, whether you're religious or not, we're all imperfect human beings, trying our best\u2014the best we can, because we can't know the future. We can't know what's coming. But we also can't live in fear every step of the way.\n\nThat's America. From darkness, we found joy, hope, and light.\n\nRather than driving us apart, faith can move us together. Because all the great confessional faiths have the same fundamental basic beliefs: not just faith in a higher power, but faith to see each other as we should, not as enemies, but as neighbors; not as adversaries, but as fellow Americans.\n\nAnd as leaders of this Nation who work and pray together, there is an oath to God and country to uphold and a charge to keep: to stand in the breach and to protect our democracy, to work together to right wrongs. That's why we all came here, to make the most of our time on Earth.\n\nFor if a house divided cannot stand, surely a house united can do anything. And if we do that, I think we'll have done our duty. With history and God watching, we will have to prove that there is nothing beyond the capacity of the United States when we're united\u2014the United States.\n\nYou know, some of the senior Senators who are here used to kid me because I was quoting Irish poets on the floor of the United States Senate. And there's a poem, \"The Cure at Troy,\" written by an Irish poet who I got to know. It says: History teaches us not to hope \"on this side of the grave. But then, once in a lifetime, [that] . . . tidal wave of justice up, and hope and history rhyme.\"\n\nI honestly believe we're at one of those moments. There's so much at stake. The division has become so palpable, not just here, but around the world. We have a chance. We have a chance\u2014a chance\u2014to make hope and history rhyme, because the rest of the world is looking to us.\n\nEvery time I'd walk out of my Grandpa Finnegan's house up in Scranton\u2014some of you heard me say this before\u2014he'd yell, \"Joey, keep the faith.\" My grandmother would yell, \"No, Joey, spread it.\" Let's go spread the faith.",
