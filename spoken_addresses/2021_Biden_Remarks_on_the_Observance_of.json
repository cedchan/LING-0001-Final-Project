    "text": "The President. Good afternoon. Jill and I are\u2014thank you for joining us today. And we're\u2014we have a special guest, as you can see to my left here.\n\nAnd I'm thankful to our friends at the White House Historical Association and the National Park Service for helping us deliver thousands of commemorative eggs to vaccination sites in communities and health care centers all across America.\n\nEaster is a day of joy, when we celebrate resurrection and renewal. But this year, we know many are still going without the familiar comforts of the season.\n\nThe virus is not gone, and the second year in a row, most will be apart from their families or friends and a full congregation to fill us with so much joy. But the Scripture tells us, \"Joy cometh in the morning.\"\n\nAs we celebrate the renewal of this season, we know that longed-for dawn is almost here. We will rebuild our Nation. We will reengage and reimagine what we can be. We'll remember that with faith, hope, and love, anything is possible. And we look forward to next year when the White House will ring with joy of the season once again and there'll be an Easter Egg Roll, God willing.\n\nMay God bless you all, may God protect our troops, and take care of the Easter Bunny. \n\nThank you all very, very much.\n\n \n\nAll right. Stand in the middle, Easter Bunny. Right here, get in the middle.\n\nThe First Lady . Come here, Easter Bunny.\n\nThe President . All right. Nice to see you all.\n\nThe First Lady . Here you go. Here, Easter Bunny.\n\nThe President . He can't even see. You've got to squeeze. You've got it, man. All right. Thank you all.",
