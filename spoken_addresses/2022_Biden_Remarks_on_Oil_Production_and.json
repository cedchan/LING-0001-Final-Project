    "text": "The President. You're not out in the rain with the Halloweeners.\n\nQ. Yes.\n\nQ. Soon.\n\nThe President. Well, I've got to go out, so you've got to come with me. \n\nQ. We'll be there.\n\nThe President. Well, good afternoon. This is a very short statement, but a consequential one, in my view. Putin's invasion of Ukraine in March set gas prices soaring literally around the world\u2014not just here, but around the world.\n\nAnd because of the action we've taken since then, gas prices have actually come down\u2014going into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve\u2014here at home, in America. They're down more than $1.20 since their peak this summer. And they've been falling for the best of\u2014best part of the last 3 weeks.\n\nIn June, the average price\u2014not the most common price, but the average price\u2014nationwide was over $5 a gallon. Today, the average price for a gallon of gas is $3.76. That's adding up to real savings for American families, the difference between those prices. And this difference makes a difference.\n\nIn a difficult time, Americans across the country have stepped up, and they\u2014to do the right thing. But not everyone stepped up. The oil industry has not, has not met its commitment to invest in America and support the American people.\n\nOne by one, major oil companies have reported record profits, not just a fair return on\u2014for hard work. Every company is entitled to that: a fair return for the work they do or innovation they generate. It means\u2014but I mean profits so high it's hard to believe.\n\nNow, the second quarter of the profits were really high. But the third quarter\u2014last week, Shell announced that it made $9.5 billion in profits for the third quarter\u2014$9.5 billion. That's almost twice as much as it made in the third quarter of last year. And I think that's something. You think that's incredible? I thought, \"My\u2014that's as good as\u2014as high as it's going to get.\"\n\nThen along came Exxon. Exxon's profits for the third quarter were at $18.7 billion\u2014one quarter, $18.7 billion\u2014nearly triple what Exxon made last year and the most in its 152-year history. It's never made that much profit.\n\nIn the last 6 months, six of the largest oil companies have made more than $100 billion\u2014$100 billion. And we had a little discussion about this, the three of us and others. One hundred billion in profits in two\u2014less than 200 days. That's not bad.\n\nAnd here's why this\u2014here's why this matters. I think it's outrageous what their\u2014the size of the profit. Here's why it matters: If these companies were making average profits they've been making by refining oil over the last 20 years instead of the outrageous profits they're making today and if they passed the rest on to the consumers, the price of gas would come down around an additional 50 cents.\n\nIf they're investing their profits in the historic\u2014at historic rates in their U.S. operations, then America would be producing more oil today and prices would be down even further. But rather than increasing their investments in America or giving American consumers a break, their excess profits are going back to their shareholders and their buying back their stock, so the executive pay is\u2014are going to skyrocket.\n\nGive me a break. Enough is enough. Look, I'm a capitalist. You've heard me say this before: I have no problem with corporations turning a fair profit or getting the return on their investment and innovation. But this isn't remotely what's happening.\n\nOil companies' record profits today are not because they're doing something new or innovative. Their profits are a windfall of war\u2014the windfall from the brutal conflict that's ravaging Ukraine and hurting tens of millions of people around the globe. You know, at a time of war, any company receiving historic windfall profits like this has a responsibility to act beyond their narrow self-interest of its executives and shareholders.\n\nI think they have a responsibility to act in the interest of their consumers, their community, and their country; to invest in America by increasing production and refining capacity. Because they\u2014they don't want to do that. They have the opportunity to do that\u2014lowering prices for consumers at the pump.\n\nYou know, if they don't, they're going to pay a higher tax on their excess profits and face other restrictions. My team will work with Congress to look at these options that are available to us and others. It's time for these companies to stop war profiteering, meet their responsibilities to this country, and give the American people a break and still do very well.\n\nThe American people are going to judge who's standing with them and who is only looking out for their own bottom line. I know where I stand, and I want to let the\u2014I'm\u2014going to hear more from me about this when the Congress gets back.\n\nThank you all very, very much. Appreciate it.\n\nPresident-Elect Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva of Brazil \n\nQ. Mr. President\u2014how was your call with President Lula today, Mr. President? How was your call with Lula from Brazil today, Mr. President?\n\nThe President. What?\n\nQ. Your call with Lula from Brazil, the President-elect\u2014how was it?\n\nThe President. It went very well. We're putting a team together to get together and discuss what we can do together. He wants to focus on the environment, democracy, and dealing with the poor in his country and saving the Amazon.\n\nQ. Are you inviting him to the White House?",
