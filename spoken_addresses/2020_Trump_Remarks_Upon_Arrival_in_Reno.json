It's\u2014it was reported on NBC by not a very good reporter that there are a thousand people. Well, there are many times that. So, you know, you'll see that. The place is packed. It was\u2014lines up 2 days ago.\n\n\nAnd tomorrow, as you know, we're going to Las Vegas. We're also going to California. We're going\u2014we're doing a tour for 3 days, and then we'll go back to New York, where we have more things to do.\n\n\nSo we're very busy. The country is doing well. Jobs are doing fantastically well. I think the virus, hopefully, is rounding the turn, rounding the corner. The vaccines are going to be out soon. The therapeutics have been fantastic. Already, remdesivir and others\u2014the plasma\u2014have had a very big impact if you look at the results.\n\n\nSo we've had a lot of good things happening, and it's great to be in this big State, in this great State.

I think we're up pretty substantially in the real polls.\n\n\nAnd we're up, I think, almost everywhere in the real polls. The real polls show us doing very well in Florida, very well in North Carolina, very well in Pennsylvania. I think we're doing well in New Hampshire\u2014really well in New Hampshire. We're doing\u2014you know, we won Ohio by a lot, and we're going to win it by, I think, even more this time. And Michigan\u2014I guess we just got a poll. We're up by about 2 points, right? So I think we're doing very well.\n\n\nAnd Joe Biden is sleeping or whatever he's doing in his basement. He doesn't seem to come out a lot. And we sort of are taking the other approach.\n\n\nSo we'll see you over at the venue. You're going to see a tremendous crowd as usual.\n\n\nThank you. Thank you very much.",
