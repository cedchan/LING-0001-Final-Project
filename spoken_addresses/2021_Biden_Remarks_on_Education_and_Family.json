    "text": "The President. My name is Joe Biden. I'm Jill's husband. [ Laughter ] And just like the lovely lady in blue over here is a professor at a community college, my wife also works for your husband. I\u2014and thank you for the warm welcome today at the airport. Appreciate it very, very much.\n\nAnd Tim Kaine, one of the great Senators and great, great friend. And a guy I've relied on most of my career\u2014when I was in the Senate, we worked together; and as Vice President; and now\u2014is Bobby Scott. Bobby, thank you for everything you do. And, Congresswoman Luria, we even got to meet when you were in uniform, I think, if I'm not mistaken. And you're doing a great job, and thank you for being here.\n\nAnd to all the faculty and the management and the folks here at the community college.\n\nYou know, one of the things that I really found interesting, Jaiden, is that\u2014the major you took\u2014cybersecurity. We spent a lot of time, as my colleagues in the Congress and the Senate can tell you, worrying and dealing on\u2014with cybersecurity. And it's really important that\u2014now that we get this under control. And we have the best trained people in the world, and you're going to be among them.\n\nAnd I'm here today at Tidewater Community College to talk about the America's Family Plan and\u2014that I announced last week\u2014a once-in-a-generation investment in our families, in our children that addresses what people care most about and most need\u2014the investment we need to win the competition\u2014the competition with other nations in the future. Because we're in a race. We're in a race.\n\nIt all starts with access to a good education, as you all know. When America made 12 years of public education universal in America in the early 1900s, it made us the best educated nation in the world, and you saw the benefits that came from that. But the rest of the world has caught up to us. The rest of the world has caught up to us. They are not waiting. And 12 years is no longer enough to compete with the world in the 21st century and lead the 21st century.\n\nThat's why my American Families Plan guarantees 4 additional years of public education for every person in America, starting as early as we can.\n\nWe were at an elementary school earlier today. And what we're talking about here is\u2014it means universal, high-quality preschool\u2014for 3- and 4-year-olds\u2014not daycare, preschool. And the research has shown, here at the great universities in this State and others, that children of that age who go to school, they are far more likely to graduate from high school and continue their education beyond that, rather than start off behind the eight ball if they come from families that are not\u2014don't have educations\u2014college educations.\n\nYou know, a lot of kids start kindergarten hearing a million fewer words having spoken than other families, and it's an unfair disadvantage. But every child is capable. Every child is capable of learning.\n\nSo we just visited, by the way, a fifth-grade classroom in Yorktown earlier today, where the students are\u2014back together with their classmates and teachers in school. And we saw what's\u2014what being in school means for those kids.\n\nSafely reopening the majority of the K-through-8 schools was one of my top priorities in my first 100 days, because there's so much that happens when they don't have the certitude and the companionship and the familiarity of being with their friends. There's an awful lot of need in this pandemic for mental health facilities and counseling.\n\nAnd we met that goal by working with the Governor here to get educators and school staff vaccinated and to get them the resources they needed to open up safely.\n\nAnd I've often said that children are the kite strings that keep our national ambitions aloft. We say \"all those kids,\" but they're all our children. They're all our children. And they are the kite strings that literally lift our national ambitions aloft. So we've got to invest in them\u2014invest in our children\u2014to invest in the future.\n\nAnd we can't stop there. We're going to add 2 years of community college on top of that. You just heard Jill talk about how community colleges and how it can change lives. Well, students here, at the community colleges across the country, know why.\n\nFor some, it's 2 years of community college to earn enough credits to transfer to a 4-year university\u2014which is available almost in every single State\u2014to become a teacher, an entrepreneur, or anything else. For some, it's getting extra training through a certificate program to get a good-paying job and a business in town.\n\nWe just met with the students at the HVAC workshop, ambitious, talented students, who are up to taking the next step in their lives. And with the skills they're learning here\u2014and some of the students will go on to be plumbers and members of the Pipefitters Local 110, electricians\u2014look, it means higher union wages with guaranteed health care and pensions.\n\nAnd you know, it's kind of amazing\u2014one of the things\u2014I don't know if you know\u2014the First Lady of this State understands; she does, I'm positive\u2014that an awful lot of folks who even get an opportunity to go to community college still can't get there because of food, transportation, and those other costs. And so we're going to increase Pell Grants so they'll qualify\u2014every\u2014no, it would make a gigantic difference. It will make a gigantic difference.\n\nBy the way, I have to admit: If I didn't have these positions, I'd be sleeping in the Lincoln bedroom\u2014[ laughter ]\u2014rather than the Vice\u2014the President's bedroom. But it really\u2014you know, it really is how to start to transform a life and family and community and our economy: by investing\u2014investing in the people.\n\nEvery child has a capacity to learn. And I've\u2014if I've heard it once, I've heard from Jill a thousand times: \"Joe, any country that outeducates us will outcompete us.\" And that's a fact. And she'll be deeply involved in leading this effort as well.\n\nThe second thing: The American Families Plan is going to provide access to quality, affordable childcare, keeping parents\u2014helping parents go back to work, providing a lifeline and benefits for children as they do better in school throughout their lives.\n\nYou know, it guarantees low- and middle-income families pay no more than 7 percent of their income for high-quality care for children up to the age of 5. And that makes a gigantic difference. There's millions of women out of work today not, because they're not qualified for the jobs they have, but they can't take care of their children and do their job. And the cost of childcare is extraordinary.\n\nI was a single father when I first got elected to the Senate. I had two young boys raised after their mom and sister were killed, and I've\u2014had I not had the family I had, I'd never been able to do it. And I'm not joking about that. And I was a Senator; I was making a decent salary.\n\nThe most hard-pressed working families won't have to spend a dime if in fact my plan works. If you're low-income folks, you'll be able to get childcare for free.\n\nThird, the American Families Plan is going to finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid and medical leave\u2014paid family and medical leave. We're one of the few industrialized countries in the entire world that doesn't have this feature. No one should have to choose between a job and a paycheck or taking care of themselves, their parent, their spouse, or a child that's ill. They should have that opportunity.\n\nAnd the fourth piece of the plan: The American Families Plan puts money directly in the pockets of millions of Americans. In March, we extended the tax credit for low- and middle-income families with children.\n\nNow, if I could hold a second here, what\u2014you know, if you have\u2014make enough money and you're paying taxes, you end up in a situation where you get to deduct $2,000 per child\u2014as a tax benefit. You don't get it back, but you get to deduct it.\n\nWell, if you're a minimum-wage worker, you're not paying much tax. And if you're making less than that, which many people are, you're not paying any Federal tax. So you get no benefit.\n\nSo we put in place\u2014and a number of my Republican colleagues shared the view too\u2014although none on the voting floor\u2014but they\u2014but I think they share it as well\u2014and that is: Up to $3,000 per child, 6 years and older; and $3,600 for a child that is over 6 years\u2014under 6 years of age. That means two parents and two young kids with\u2014they get a check back from the Government for $7,200 in their pockets, which they're doing now, which can help them take care of your family. And it will benefit more than 65 million children. And all the data shows it will cut child poverty in half this year\u2014cut it in half.\n\nMy plan extends the tax credit at least through the year 2025. Because what's going to happen in 2025, as the press knows, is the tax cuts of the last President expire. And we're going go back\u2014that put us $2 trillion in debt. And then, we're going to compete as to what tax credits there are. I think it's about time we start giving tax breaks and tax credits to working class families and middle class families instead of just the very wealthy.\n\nAnd here's what the American Families Plan doesn't do: It doesn't add a single penny to our deficit. It's paid for by making sure corporate America and the wealthiest 1 percent just pay their fair share. I come from the corporate capital of the world. More corporations are incorporated in the State of Delaware than all the rest of the Nation combined. And I'm not anticorporate, but it's about time they start paying their fair share.\n\nIt's about making a choice. You know, we have out there\u2014this year, you had 50 corporations\u2014make, you know, $40 billion\u2014that didn't pay a single penny in taxes. Not a single penny. I don't want to punish anybody, but everybody should chip in. Everybody should pay something along the road here.\n\nThe choice is about who the economy serves. And so I plan on giving tax breaks to the working class folks and making everybody pay their fair share.\n\nHere's an example of that choice: If you ask the top 1 percent to pay the same tax rate they paid in 2001, when George Bush was President, that would generate $13 billion a year. Now, that's enough for us to take around $11 * of that $13 billion and provide for 2 years of community college free for every student in America.\n\nSo what's fair? Go from 36 to 39.6 percent, like it used to be, and be able to take care of ever\u2014what's better? Just think about it in terms of what's better for America\u2014not Democrat, Republican, Independent\u2014what's going to grow America more? What's going to grow America more? What's going to make us more competitive, stronger? What's going to make us better educated?\n\nSo, for folks at home, I'd like to ask a question: Do we want to give the wealthiest people in America another tax cut? Or do you want to give every high school graduate the ability to earn a community college degree on their way to good-paying jobs or on their way to 4 years of school in industries of the future\u2014health care, IT, cybersecurity, you name it?\n\nLook, another example: For too long, we've had a two-tiered tax system. Working families pay taxes they owe on the wages they earn, while some of the wealthiest Americans avoid paying anything close to that fair share.\n\nMy plan revitalizes and\u2014the capacity of the IRS to crack down on\u2014there's a number of studies, from the former Secretary of Treasury on, that millionaires and billionaires are able to avoid taxes and cheat in avoiding those taxes because we have so few agents in the IRS.\n\nIt's\u2014the consensus is, if you increase the disclosure requirements for banks and financial institutions on accounts for the wealthiest Americans to reduce tax cheating, you will have two steps\u2014two steps would recover $70 billion per year that currently goes unreported and unpaid.\n\nNow\u2014and we've been hearing about this for the last 10 years. Instead of cutting a number of agents, we should be increasing the number of agents\u2014not hounding anyone, just being able to get access to information. And shut down all the tax havens from the islands to\u2014anyway, I won't go into it. I can get a little carried away with this.\n\nBut look\u2014and we can take this money\u2014this money and pay for universal pre-K for every 3- and 4-year-old in America. So what is better? Making people just pay their fair share. Paid family leave. Childcare costs of working families, maximum of 7 percent of their income.\n\nAgain, it's a choice. It's more important to shield millionaires from paying their fair share? Or is it more important that every child gets a real opportunity to succeed from an early age and ease the burden on working families?\n\nThird, we have a loophole in our tax system called \"stepped-up basis.\" It's also known as the trust fund loophole. For example, if I had a million dollars in stock that I bought, and it made a million dollars and I was going to cash it in, I'd have to pay capital gain on that million dollars.\n\nBut if, God forbid, on the way\u2014go back to where I was\u2014on the way to where we're talking about\u2014on the way to cash in my stock, I got hit by a car and got killed, I can leave it to my daughter, and she pays no tax, a tax that was owed 2 seconds earlier.\n\nIt's not an inheritance tax. It was a tax was owed 2 seconds earlier. But that's what \"stepped-up basis\" means. It's a person passes away and leaves the stock in their\u2014to their son or daughter; son or daughter don't have to pay anything on that multimillion-dollar gain when they sell that stock. And that's worth a lot of money.\n\nLook, they may be decent and honorable people\u2014and they are\u2014but the last thing Americans with around\u2014with the amount of wealth\u2014needs is another tax break.\n\nWe need to make a choice to eliminate the loophole\u2014only the gains above for people\u2014only the gains above people making $2 million a year\u2014or, excuse me, a couple\u2014a rate of * capital gains rate for people making more than a million dollars a year, which, by the way, would affect three-tenths of 1 percent of all taxpayers\u2014three-tenths of 1 percent of the top 1 percent.\n\nAnd close another loophole, like the real estate investor loophole, where the wealthy is simply paying the same rate on their wages and investment income. That raises $40 billion a year for the next 10 years.\n\nThe reason I'm bothering to do this is, I keep hearing out in the press, \"Biden is going to raise your taxes.\" Anybody making less than $400,000 a year will not pay a single penny in taxes. And we will not increase the deficit either, unlike the last gigantic tax cut, which increased the deficit by $2 trillion.\n\nIt's about balancing the system and growing the economy. It means wealthy investors no longer pay lower marginal tax rates than their secretary pays\u2014the secretary in their office.\n\nDo you want to know what that would do? That would take that money and extend the lifechanging middle class tax cut and put it in place for American Rescue Plan and expand childcare tax credit\u2014I mentioned earlier, that's $1,700 * in the pockets of a family with two kids for\u2014now through\u2014through 2025. Look, just closing these loopholes by taxing investment income at the same rate we\u2014for\u2014as wages for the wealthiest Americans, we'd have enough to extend this again through 2025.\n\nSo I ask again: Is it more important to keep these tax loopholes for millionaires\u2014who are good people; they're not bad folks, but\u2014or would we rather put $7,200 in the pockets of working moms and dads every year if they have two children?\n\nFolks, trickle-down economies\u2014economics has never worked. For too long, we've had an economy that gives every break in the world to the folks who need it the least. It's time to grow the economy from the bottom up and the middle out.\n\nWe can choose to give hard-working families a break\u2014a tax break, in effect. We can choose to invest in our students. We can choose an economy that rewards work, not just wealth, and that chooses\u2014the choice I'm making and the vast majority of the American people support is: Let's give people a shot. Given even half a chance, the American people have never, ever, ever let their country down. Imagine if we give them a full chance. Imagine what it would mean for them and their families and for our country.\n\nWe're the United States of America. There's nothing\u2014nothing\u2014we've been unable to do when we do it together. So let's get together. Let's get this done. Because the truth of the matter is that we can do this and grow the economy. I won't go into all the other statistics, but the plan is estimated to grow the economy another trillion dollars. This will grow the economy. Everybody would be better off.\n\nSo I want to thank you all for doing your part here to make sure that not only you're educating and giving people a real shot\u2014a real shot\u2014at a real life, consistent with their talents and their capacities, not limit it because they don't have the money. And we're going to give it to a lot more people.\n\nI promise you\u2014I promise you\u2014America will be much stronger for it. Because, like I said, if we're setting out a universal education, it wouldn't just be 12 years anymore. It would be\u2014it would be those 14 years\u201416 years I'm talking about: 2 to start, and 2 at the other end.\n\nAnd as your State has done under your Governor and your Senator and your Congresspersons, your State\u2014if you got\u2014if you get 4 years out of here\u20142 years out here, that's 2 years towards a State university. You cut tuition in half for a 4-year degree as well.\n\nSo there's an awful lot of possibilities, an awful lot of hope. And the good news is, I think there's overwhelming, bipartisan support for this. You look at the polling data: Republican voters overwhelmingly support it. Now I just got to get some of my Republican colleagues to support it.\n\nSo thank you all, and God bless you. And thank you for the work you're doing. And may God protect our troops. Thank you so much.\n\nCoronavirus Vaccination Efforts \n\nQ. Mr. President, when do you think the U.S. will reach herd immunity? When do you believe the U.S. will reach herd immunity?\n\nThe President. I think, by the end of the summer, we'll be in a very different position than we are now. As you know, I've worked very hard to make sure we have over 600 million doses of vaccine.\n\nWe're going to continue to make sure that's available. We're going to increase that number across the board as well so we can also be helping other nations once we take care of all Americans.\n\nAnd what's happening now is, all the talk about how people were not going to get shots, they were not going to be involved\u2014look at what that was\u2014we were told that was most likely to be among people over 65 years of age. But now people over 65 years of age, over 80 percent, have now been vaccinated and 66 percent fully vaccinated. And there's virtually no difference between White, Black, Hispanic, Asian American.\n\nAnd so\u2014because what we've done, under some criticism, is we have expanded access to vaccinations to familiar places\u201440,000 drugstores now. Also, all of the community health centers that are available all across the Nation. Mobile units going out. And it's getting better and better and better. And so that's why we're leading the world.\n\nWhen I got elected, I said, in the first 100 days, we'd get 100 million people vaccinated. I was wrong; we got 230 million vaccinated.\n\nI think you'll see\u2014and there's a debate, you know\u2014and I'll end with this\u2014there's a debate on what constitutes herd immunity. \"Is it 70 percent of the population? Is it 68 percent? Is it 81 percent?\"\n\nThe point is that, by the end of the summer\u2014right now, every single person, 16 years or older, doesn't have to wait in line\u2014can show up and get a vaccination now. My plea to everyone: Get vaccinated now please.\n\nThank you.",
