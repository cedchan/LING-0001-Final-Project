    "text": "The President. I know you always asked me, \"How are we doing?\" We're going to win this time around, I think. I feel really good about our chances. I haven't been in all the House races, but I think we're going to keep the Senate and pick up a seat. I think we have a chance to win in the House. I don't think we're going\u2014not \"win,\" keeping the House.\n\nSo I'm optimistic. I really am. And I find that, you know, most of the debate that occurs in the places I visit\u2014I know you don't think it, but I think we have pretty good crowds. They're fairly enthusiastic. You don't write it that way, but they are.\n\nAnd I find that the thing that gives me the most confidence is the fact that the policies we've initiated, people care about. Now, they want more. They write to me, but I don't know anybody who's really opposed to us bringing down medical prices and prescription drugs and all those other things.\n\nSo I feel optimistic.\n\nAnd you can smile. I'm okay. All right?\n\nQ. Mr. President\u2014\u2014\n\nOil and Gas Industry \n\nQ. Mr. President, could I just ask you one quick question?\n\nThe President. No.\n\nQ. You said that you were going to meet with the oil companies.\n\nThe President. Well, I\u2014\u2014\n\nQ. When is that going to happen?\n\nThe President. Well, I\u2014nothing is set up. Thank you.",
