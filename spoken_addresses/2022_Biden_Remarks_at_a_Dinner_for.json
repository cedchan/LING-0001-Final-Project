And Jill and I have been trying to keep from the press the fact that this is our private home. \n\nI just learned an awful lot about\u2014anyway, I'll tell you about it later\u2014from the\u2014but welcome. And you know, I thought today was a good day. And I used to always kid Barack for\u2014President Obama. And I'd always say to him, \"All politics is personal,\" meaning that it makes a difference when you get to know someone. Whether you agree or not, it makes a difference to look in their eyes and understand a little bit more what's in their heart.\n\nAnd I thought today was a very good day. We disagreed on some things, but I found that on the central issues that we talked about, relating to everything from democracy to the notion\u2014the specific notions of\u2014from health care to the environment, all the things we talked about\u2014there's overwhelming agreement.\n\nAnd I think that\u2014I hope that getting to know one another better will make it easier to accomplish what we all want done. Because, you know, it is all personal. And all the people we represent, it matters to them deeply that we get it right.\n\nAnd so I'd like to welcome you all. And enjoy the meal. Thank you.\n\nAnd the press\u2014[ applause ]\u2014they tell me you're welcome to go swimming in the pond if you'd like. \n\nThank you.\n\nTelevised Hearing of the House Select Committee To Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol \n\nQ . Did you watch any of today's hearings?\n\nThe President. Didn't have time.\n\nQ. No?\n\nThe President. No.",
