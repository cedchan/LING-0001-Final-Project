Quick question on voting: Any thoughts on Stacey Abrams skipping your speech today, sir? Are you insulted she is skipping the speech?\n\nThe President. I'm insulted you asked the question. I spoke with Stacey this morning. We have a great relationship. We got our scheduling mixed up. I'm going to be\u2014I talked with her at length this morning. We're all on the same page, and everything's fine.\n\nQ. How about the other boycotts, sir, other boycotts of the speech?\n\nQ. \u2014with Ossoff?\n\nVoting Rights Legislation \n\nQ. What do you risk, sir, by putting so much on the line for voting rights when you know the state of the Senate?\n\nThe President. Say that, again, please?\n\nQ. What do you risk politically, sir, when you know the state of the Senate?\n\nThe President. I risk not saying what I believe. That's what I risk.\n\nThis is one of those defining moments.

Well, I am concerned about the pandemic just because it\u2014worldwide, it's not slowing up very much.\n\nAnd, thank God, what we've been able to do is, I've been able\u2014does this look stupid? \n\n \n\nI've been able to generate significant Federal help, in terms of folks both coming into the hospitals and administering all the help that these States need. That's what we're doing now. But I'm confident we're on the right track.\n\nThank you all.\n\nQ. Mr. President\u2014 \u2014with Ossoff?",
