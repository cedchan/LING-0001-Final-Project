Mr. President, why are you going to Walter Reed?\n\nThe President. I'm going out to visit some of the soldiers and sailors that are\u2014been wounded and look at the vaccination procedure.\n\nI've been at Walter Reed a lot. I spent almost 6 months there myself as a patient. And in addition to that, as Vice President, every single Christmas, we spent all of Christmas Day at Walter Reed. These kids are amazing.\n\nAnd thank God there's not as many people to visit, so all the people I'm seeing today, who are being treated, or\u2014four of them amputees\u2014are people who, in fact, are retired and\u2014but they're real heroes.\n\nAnd then, we're going to go see the vaccination distribution. So they're\u2014I spent a lot of time at Walter Reed. They're great Americans. They're great people.\n\nNice to see you all.\n\nQ. Any progress on your COVID bill?\n\nQ. Do you support passing COVID relief through budget reconciliation?\n\nThe President. I'm sorry?\n\nCoronavirus Relief Legislation \n\nQ. Do you support passing COVID relief through budget reconciliation?\n\nThe President. I support passing COVID relief with support from Republicans if we can get it. But the COVID relief has to pass. There's no if, ands, or buts.\n\nThank you.\n\nQ. And if it doesn't have Republican support, Mr. President?",
