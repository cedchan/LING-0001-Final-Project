    "text": "The President. Well, Governor, thank you very much. Before I begin, we're on National Guard property. I just wanted to say that the National Guard, obviously, is controlled by the Governor, except when federalized. And I have federalized you a number of times nationwide to fight fires, to fight every disaster we've had. And my son was a major in the National Guard. And I think the people don't quite understand the extent\u2014the extent\u2014of the work you do and the risk you take for us.\n\nAnd secondly, there's an expression where I come from: \"God made man, then he made some firefighters.\" You're all crazy\u2014[ laughter ]\u2014but I love you. I grew up in a neighborhood called Claymont, Delaware, when we moved from Scranton when coal died. And although my parents weren't in the coal mines\u2014they were in sales\u2014but the economy shriveled, and we moved down to this little steel town. And I went to a little Catholic school across from the fire department\u2014a fire station. And everybody I grew up with, you either became a cop, a firefighter, or a priest. I wasn't qualified for any of them, so here I am. \n\nI\u2014but you know, just so you know, I've done too many individual and mass funerals for firefighters and hotshots and\u2014and you're an incredible group of people, I mean, a truly incredible group of people. Anybody\u2014and the overwhelming human instinct is, you run away from a fire, not into it. And the only thing that protects firefighters is more firefighters\u2014the only thing. More firefighters.\n\nAnd I just wanted to say that at the outset, because I\u2014you have my indebted gratitude. And my fire department saved my life literally, not figuratively. My house got struck by lightning, and it mostly burned down. It had to be rebuilt.\n\nSaved\u2014the thick\u2014the smoke was so thick, Gov. It was literally that thick. And you couldn't see through the windows or out the windows. And the floors were collapsing, and these guys went in and did two things: Most importantly, they got my wife out\u2014I was in Washington when it happened\u2014and saved our cat. But equally important, almost\u2014not equally, but important\u2014I have a '67 Corvette they got out. \n\nAnd so, at any rate\u2014but my point is, you're incredible. And so, Governor, thank you. And Senators Heinrich and Luj\u00e1n, thank you very much for all you do. And Teresa Leger Fern\u00e1ndez and\u2014you know, Herrell, and you know, Stansbury, and all Members of the House doing a great job.\n\nAnd\u2014but maybe the proudest thing I've done is, I appointed the first Native American to be a Cabinet member. But she's only been in New Mexico 35 generations. You're a newcomer. A newcomer.\n\nBut look, a special thanks again to the firefighters\u2014over 4,000 of you. Over 4,000 of you are putting your lives on the line.\n\nAnd we're about to receive a briefing about the largest, most destructive wildfire in America so far this year and the largest wildfire in New Mexico's history. I just flew over some of the damage. And Air Force One is so damn big we couldn't go in, but we flew the perimeter of the fire. And it's an astounding amount of territory.\n\nAnd the impact on families that have been there for so long are so consequential. And in this\u2014in a way\u2014you know, there's, you know, nearly 700,000 acres. And a new fire just started\u2014have just started. Thousands of people displaced. Ranchers wiped out. Schools shuttered. And wilderness that looks like a moonscape. You could see parts of it where I was able to see.\n\nAnd I'm thinking about what you're thinking, and that is our responsibility. It's not a gift. We have a responsibility to help this State recover, to help the families who have been here for centuries, and the beautiful northern New Mexico villagers who can't go home and whose livelihoods have been fundamentally changed.\n\nGovernor, let me be clear: We will be here for you in response and recovery for as long as it takes. As long as it takes. And I learned something about this Governor: When she asks something, I just say, \"Yes.\" But I don't think there's\u2014\u2014\n\nGovernor Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico . Can you get the Legislature to do that?\n\nThe President. Well, that's\u2014[ laughter ]\u2014that's what we're trying. You know, I've publicly gone on record of supporting it\u2014of supporting it. That is 100 percent\u2014anyway. There\u2014I hope we're able to get that done. I know that Ben Ray is working like hell in the House to get passage. But we're going to\u2014I have a little more trouble in the United States Senate. We have 50 Democratic Senators, which means we have 51 \"presidents.\" \n\nAnd so it's\u2014you know, we've got to get a consensus, and we can't\u2014not a consensus, in some cases, if they insist on it being a\u2014requiring cloture, and we need 60 votes. So it remains to be seen.\n\nAnd so\u2014but you know, when you asked for major disaster declaration, Governor, I immediately responded, providing millions of dollars in housing assistance and cash grants and funding for emergency responders\u2014not because they're doing any favor; it's an obligation. I think we have a responsibility, as a Government, as a\u2014to deal with the communities who are put in\u2014in such jeopardy.\n\nAnd today I'm announcing the Federal Government is covering 100 percent of the cost of debris removal and emergency protective measures for the next critical months that are\u2014in this recovery.\n\nAnd then there's going to be a strong bridge until we\u2014that we pass the Hermit's Peak Fire Assistance Act, introduced by Senator Luj\u00e1n and Senator Heinrich and your\u2014and Senator Fern\u00e1ndez, as well as Stansbury, to fully compensate\u2014fully compensate survivors for their total loss.\n\nWe're also providing funding and loans for small businesses, farmers, and ranchers. And we need to be sure this doesn't happen again. We know the circumstances of Hermit's Park and Calfe * Canyon Fires are unique, starting with the prescribed burn.\n\nEvery year, the Forest Service, to put this in perspective\u2014they do a pretty damn good job\u2014conduct 4,500 prescribed burns. 99.8 percent go as planned. And\u2014but this time, tragically, it did not. And that's why the Forest Service has just put a complete pause on prescribed burns in our\u2014in the Forest Service lands. And it's conducting an intensive 90-day review, which will make public the\u2014all the detail of that review. And this needs to happen. And I'll be briefed on the results, and we'll brief the world on the results\u2014the country on the results.\n\nAnd for folks at home, there are hundreds of fire\u2014of Federal personnel on the ground trying to help you get through this. I think, if you take a look, the most important thing you can do is register with FEMA, which allows you to get assistance you deserve and you need quickly. And there's a FEMA mobile app that allows you to quickly register for assistance. And it's available in Spanish as well.\n\nAnd our Director of FEMA, who I think has done an incredible job\u2014how many folks you have here now roughly?\n\nFederal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Bennett Criswell . Just under 400.\n\nThe President. Just under 400 here. And it's\u2014I don't\u2014we\u2014if you don't have phone service yet, you have Disaster Recovers\u2014Recovery Centers in Mora and Las Vegas where you can register as well.\n\nAnd we also have a team on the ground to help you register. And FEMA is calling every person who is denied assistance\u2014anybody denied assistance\u2014to ensure they get the help they need and in the language they speak.\n\nA lot of, you know\u2014you know, you've got to know how to know. You've got to know what you need to know to be able to get something done. I can walk into the Library of Congress\u2014one of the great libraries in the world\u2014if you don't know how to work the card catalog, it's not very much use to you. I mean it. You've got to know how to know.\n\nAnd so we've learned, in our administration, that it's not just enough to provide the help but let people know how they can access the help, and when they can't, how they can go about to fix that. And so eligible residents can sign up for a State program that provides benefits to buy groceries and hot meals as well.\n\nFor the longer term, but beginning right now, we have to help with the combined impacts of drought and wildfires and\u2014which threaten your vital watershed. And it's hard to explain to people back east when I talk about this, because we've gone to\u2014we've spent some time, the FEMA Director and I, in other parts of the country\u2014in Northern California, Oregon, up in Idaho\u2014to explain what we're talking about, the scope and size and the consequence, and how the watershed is not\u2014not literally\u2014but in fact are evaporating in many places. Find yourself in a position where it has vital, vital impact.\n\nAnd through the bipartisan infrastructure, we've\u2014are already investing hundreds of millions of dollars in the State\u2014of your drought relief and wildfire mitigation and water infrastructure.\n\nAnd as the monsoon season approaches, we've authorized another $22 million to protect critical water infrastructure from postfire flooding and debris flows. And the work starts today. It starts today. Not next week, not next month. Today.\n\nThe bottom line is, Gov\u2014to the people of New Mexico: We'll do whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to follow your leadership and what\u2014telling us what you need. And I promise you, I\u2014and I\u2014and we kind of joke. They say the \"Governor is on the phone.\" I say, \"Just tell her yes.\" And then I start the conversation. Y'all think I'm kidding. I'm not kidding. \n\nSo I'm going to stop here. And I guess we're going to get\u2014start the briefing, if we could. And\u2014but I guess, David, I'm talking to you first. You're Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, so I'm going to yield to you. Okay?\n\n ",
