The far-sighted vision that led you to look far ahead to the distant evolution of a great and growing city, and the sense of civic responsibility that impelled you to plan for its enlightened development, with wise regard for the health of the inhabitants and the beauty [p.156] and convenience of their surroundings, are an inspiration to all who trust in the capacity of democracies to evolve leadership that is at once idealistic and practical.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
