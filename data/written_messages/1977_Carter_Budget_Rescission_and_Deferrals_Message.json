Two of the revised deferrals are increases which relate to programs in the Department of Defense while the third reflects a decrease in a Department of Transportation deferral. The combined effect of these revisions is to increase the amount deferred by $27.7 million.\n\nThe details of the rescission withdrawal and each deferral are contained in the attached reports.\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House, March 9, 1977.",
