Today is both a cause for celebration and a time to remember and honor the brave men and women who fought in the name of Cuban liberty. We pay tribute to the many sacrifices of Cuba's freedom fighters, and we will continue to stand with the people of Cuba as they seek democracy, peace, and freedom.\n\nThe Cuban people deserve a government that upholds democratic values and promotes economic and religious liberties. Heroes like Jose Marti and Antonio Maceo gave their last breaths in the cause of securing a government worthy of the Cuban people, one that protects the rights and dignity of its citizens. Together, we continue to fight for a free and democratic Cuba.\n\nTo the proud people of Cuba and to Cuban Americans, Melania and I send our warmest wishes as you observe this momentous day. Let us recommit to achieving a prosperous future for the Cuban people.",
