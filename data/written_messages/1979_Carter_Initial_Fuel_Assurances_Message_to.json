The current alternatives envision uranium stockpiles with size ranges between 2 million and 10 million separative work units. Present estimates of the cost for these program alternatives, based on the current market value of the uranium fuel and the enrichment services, are approximately a half billion to more than 2 billion dollars.\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House, February 23, 1979.",
