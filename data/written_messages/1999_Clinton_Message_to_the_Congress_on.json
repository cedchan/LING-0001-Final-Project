In accordance with this provision, I have sent the enclosed notice, stating that the emergency declared with respect to the Government of Cuba's destruction of two unarmed U.S.-registered civilian aircraft in international airspace north of Cuba on February 24, 1996, is to continue in effect beyond March 1, 1999, to the Federal Register for publication.\n\nWILLIAM J. CLINTON\n\nThe White House,\n\nFebruary 24, 1999.",
