    "text": "My dear Mr. Davis:\n\nI have been especially interested in your celebration of the tenth anniversary of radio broadcasting.\n\nNever before in all history has a new system of communication made such mighty progress in so short a time. It has come today to the first rank in the diffusion of ideas. It has already begun to modify the character of American life and fortunately, its tremendous influence is all on the side of progress.\n\nIt seems but a short time since, at the request of the then few broadcasting stations, I called the First National Conference on Radio in 1922. Then we were groping dimly for methods of regulation that by prevention of interference we could enable adequate development of the art. In large degree this development was accomplished by the voluntary regulation of broadcasting stations which we developed at that time.\n\nIn the views expressed as to the promise of radio in that first Conference, some perhaps thought that imaginations had run riot. We then discussed with pride the hundred thousand receiving sets already in use. But much as we imagined at that time, none of us were so hardy as to prophesy that within eight years there would be receiving sets in half the homes in the United States.\n\nToday the high level of service and the wholesome character of programs should be a proper source of pride to all engaged in it and is a development in our National life of immeasurable importance. Yours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
