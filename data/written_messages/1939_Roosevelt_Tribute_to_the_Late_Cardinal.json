    "text": "Most Reverend Bernard J. Sheil, Chicago, Illinois A CAREER of great goodness and usefulness has been brought to an untimely close with the passing of Cardinal Mundelein. He served his day and generation with unfailing fidelity to the highest principles of Christianity. As a citizen who gloried in our American democracy he was the advocate and exemplar of justice and righteousness whether in the relation of the individual to the state or in the field of international affairs. His influence was always potent for peace. My personal acquaintance with Cardinal Mundelein began when he was Bishop of Brooklyn and I mourn the loss of a true friend, a close friend for many years.",
