These bonds have grown in strength and vitality during the years of your leadership. Your dedicated service to Austria and to the principles and institutions of Western democracy have earned the respect and gratitude of free men everywhere. Under your stewardship Austria has steadfastly executed her mission as a bastion of freedom, a refuge for the oppressed, and an exemplar of the noblest traditions of Western civilization. As you prepare to lay down the demanding duties of the Chancellorship, please accept on my own behalf, and on the behalf of the people of the United States, our sincere best wishes. Sincerely,\n\nJOHN F. KENNEDY",
