What more is there to be said to stress the importance of American citizenship of the broadest, truest and highest type? Let us hold fast to these ideals and carry them forward in the future welfare of our united Nation.\n\nWere I to solicit the aid of the Legion in the solution of any one of the many pressing problems which confront us, it would perhaps be that of unemployment. The Legion is in a position, with its extended membership of all classes-a veritable cross-section of our citizenship\u2014to contribute materially to the success of the movement now well under way to absorb the unemployed into commerce and industry; and in the future development of a national prosperity, which has all but arrived.\n\nIn sending my hearty greetings I have firm faith that the entire membership of our organization will labor without ceasing to perpetuate in time of peace the fundamental institutions which they defended so valiantly in time of war.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nHarry W. Colmery, National Commander, The American Legion, Indianapolis, Indiana.",
