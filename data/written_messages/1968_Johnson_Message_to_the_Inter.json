There is no more important work facing our hemisphere. Together, we must:\n\n--assure basic education for all our people; --make our secondary schools and universities centers of excellence; and --harness science and technology in the work of education and development.\n\nThe largest share of what must be done, you must do. But I want you to know that we in the United States will help--with our resources, our technology, and the enthusiastic support of our people.\n\nIn preparing your programs you will use the tools that are at hand. But I hope your vision also will extend to the tools of tomorrow. I am particularly enthusiastic about the possibilities of combining advanced technology with advanced methods of teaching and research. Educational television already points the way. We are not far from the day when the satellite will help us\n\n--leap across the barriers that today deny good education to millions of citizens, and --unlock the doors to hidden natural resources on land and the surrounding seas.\n\nWith warm and vivid memories of my meetings with your Presidents last April, I send you greetings and best wishes for success in your deliberations.",
