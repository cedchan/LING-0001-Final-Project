    "text": "I HEARTILY congratulate the citizens of New Brunswick upon the celebration of the 250th anniversary of the settlement and the 200th anniversary of the granting of the city's charter. Few communities in our country have so rich a heritage of varied historical associations important to the Colonial, Revolutionary and later life of the Nation and concerned not only with military and political events, but also with education and religion. This celebration should stimulate community pride and National patriotism, and enlarge enthusiasm for the institutions of government, learning and spiritual ideals which are of the warp and woof of our National life.\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
