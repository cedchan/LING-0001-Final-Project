Equally important, I hope you carry away a better idea of the genuine warmth of friendship for other peoples on which the free world community is founded. As citizens of that community, you are, as the result of your studies here, better prepared to meet its burdens and its opportunities. Again my heartiest congratulations. Sincerely,\n\nJOHN F. KENNEDY",
