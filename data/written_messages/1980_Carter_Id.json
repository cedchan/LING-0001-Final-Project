It has inspired the true surrender to God which the word Moslem implies. And it has brought about a cleansing of the soul in preparation of the joyous celebration of the holiday of Id-al-Fitr.\n\nWe hope you will look back on this period of self-denial with the satisfaction of knowing that your prayers and fasting have strengthened your faith and expanded its positive influence as a force for good in modern life.\n\nJIMMY CARTER",
