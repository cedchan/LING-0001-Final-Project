    "text": "To the Congress:\n\nSeveral months ago the Governor of Puerto Rico recommended that the organic law of Puerto Rico be amended so as to permit the people of Puerto Rico to elect their own Governor. This recommendation was brought to me by the Secretary of the Interior with his approval. The Governor's suggestion has been under consideration since that time.\n\nIt has long been the policy of the Government of the United States progressively to reinforce the machinery of self-government in its territories and island possessions.\n\nPuerto Rico has universal suffrage and an elective legislature which considers and enacts measures governing its internal affairs. Laws enacted by its legislature, however, including laws of purely local concern, have been subject to approval or disapproval by Governors appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate of the United States.\n\nIn accordance with the general policy of this Government, I recommend to the Congress that it consider as soon as possible an amendment of the organic law of Puerto Rico to permit the people of Puerto Rico to elect their own Governor, and to redefine the functions and powers of the Federal Government and the Government of Puerto Rico, respectively.\n\nI have appointed a committee composed of an equal number of Puerto Ricans and of continental residents to advise me concerning changes in the organic law.\n\nThe recommendations of this Committee will be promptly submitted to the Congress for its consideration.",
