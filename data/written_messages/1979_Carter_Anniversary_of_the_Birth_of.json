In a very short time he showed us the power of love to change men's hearts and to overcome differences that decades of conflict could not resolve. In a tense and trying era he was a symbol of hope and a voice of reason.\n\nIn America and throughout the word he stands tall among the greatest champions of human fights. And we are stronger as a nation and as a world community because he made us more sensitive as individuals to the dignity and worth of others.\n\nJIMMY CARTER",
