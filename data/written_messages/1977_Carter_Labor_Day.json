Today, workers and their organizations are giving strong support to the national effort to restore our economy's health. This is in the finest tradition of organized labor, which has served not just its own members but all people through its century-long struggle for social and economic justice.\n\nOn this Labor Day, let us affirm our determination to build a future together in which all of us can enjoy the blessings of a more equitable and humane society.\n\nJIMMY CARTER",
