My heart goes out to these young sufferers\u2014living martyrs to their unselfish devotion to the nursing profession. I should greatly appreciate it if you would convey to each of them an expression of my fellow feeling for them in the sacrifice they have made and are making.\n\nAny words of mine seem feeble indeed in the face of their affliction; and yet, I cannot restrain the impulse to record my appreciation of their heroism. Because of their suffering the suffering of others was alleviated. They will ever be held in honored reverence for their unselfish ministrations.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nDoctor George Parrish, Health Officer, Los Angeles, California.",
