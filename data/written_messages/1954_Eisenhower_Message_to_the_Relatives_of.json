Arnold 8 National Street Montgomery, Alabama\n\nI am truly distressed to learn that your husband is one of those Americans who are now prisoners of the Chinese Communists.\n\nI assure you that I am keenly aware of the deep distress you are suffering. It is my hope that you and John's family secure some consolation in the thought that he was serving his country when taken prisoner and that this Nation is grateful for that service.\n\nIt is tragic that the feeling of thankfulness you must have in hearing at last that he is alive must now be joined with the heartache of concern for his well-being.\n\nYou may be very sure that your government is using every feasible means to bring your husband and all other Americans now in Communist hands, to freedom and to secure their proper treatment so long as their confinement continues. These efforts will be carried forward resolutely and tirelessly.\n\nWith assurance of my profound sympathy.\n\nDWIGHT D. EISENHOWER",
