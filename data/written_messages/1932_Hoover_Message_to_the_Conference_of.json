Their progress in education, in wealth, in participation in agriculture, industry and civic life within the relatively short period since the Civil War, is an amazing story of courage and enterprise in which the colored people take a proper pride, and which their neighbors of other races view with satisfaction and admiration.\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
