The great qualities of character by reason of which George Washington towers supreme in our history were products of the Christian virtues inculcated by his deeply religious mother and devoutly practiced by him as a professed churchman. I trust that this gathering will be inspired to a new devotion to our beloved country through its exercises commemorating his birth. Yours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
