It is indeed heartening to know that the Brigade, as an organization for all boys without distinction of class, color, or creed, enlists its energies in furtherance of the Children's Charter which the Conference formulated as a goal toward which all people of good will might work to bring health and happiness to all children. I am touched by this recognition of my part in this great undertaking and I ask you to take back to the Catholic Boys' Brigade U.S., my heartfelt appreciation. Yours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
