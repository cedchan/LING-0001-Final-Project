    "text": "This Month gives black Americans a wonderful opportunity to review their roots, their achievements and their projections; and it provides for all Americans a chance to rejoice and express pride in a heritage that adds so much to our way of life.\n\nI commend the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History on its sponsorship of this traditional observance.\n\nCalling attention to the contributions of black people to our overall progress and development, the month of February thus serves to build goodwill and understanding between all people. It gives each of us a keener appreciation of an important part of the priceless legacy which Americans of every creed, color and national origin are fortunate to share.\n\nRosalynn and I join in urging fellow citizens everywhere to help make this year's celebration especially meaningful and rewarding.\n\nJIMMY CARTER",
