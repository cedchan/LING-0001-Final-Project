    "text": "To the Senate of the United States:\n\nWith a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Wheat Trade Convention and Food Aid Convention constituting the International Wheat Agreement, 1986, opened for signature at the United Nations Headquarters, New York, from May I through June 30, 1986. The Conventions were signed by the United States on June 26, 1986. I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Conventions.\n\nThe Wheat Trade Convention, 1986, replaces the Wheat Trade Convention, 1971, and maintains the framework for international cooperation in wheat trade matters. It also continues the existence of the International Wheat Council. The Food Aid Convention, 1986, replaces the Food Aid Convention, 1980, and renews commitments of donor member states to provide minimum annual quantities of food aid to developing countries.\n\nThe United States is continuing to participate provisionally in the International Wheat Council and Food Aid Committee. The Council and the Committee have granted the United States an extension of time, through June 30, 1987, to deposit instruments of ratification.\n\nIt is my hope that the Senate will give early and favorable consideration to the two Conventions, and give its advice and consent to ratification so that ratification by the United States can be effected and instruments of ratification deposited no later than June 30, 1987.\n\nRONALD REAGAN The White House, January 20, 1987.",
