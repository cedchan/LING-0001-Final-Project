You may be sure that this pride will strengthen our determination to drive the Jap invader from your islands.\n\nWe will join you in that effort- with our armed forces, as rapidly and fully as our efforts against our enemies and our responsibilities to other liberated peoples permit. With God's help we will complete the fulfillment of the pledge we renewed when our men returned to Leyte.\n\nLet the Japanese and other enemies of peaceful Nations take warning from these great events in your country; their world of treachery, aggression, and enslavement cannot survive in the struggle against our world of freedom and peace.",
