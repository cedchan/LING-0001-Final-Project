Few operations in military history can match either the delaying action where you traded space for time in which to build up your forces, or the brilliant maneuver which has now resulted in the liberation of Seoul. I am particularly impressed by the splendid cooperation of our Army, Navy and Air Force, and I wish you would extend my thanks and congratulations to the commanders of those services--Lieutenant General Walton H. Walker, Vice Admiral Charles T. Joy and Lieutenant General George E. Stratemeyer. The unification of our arms established by you and by them has set a shining example. My thanks and the thanks of the people of all the free nations go out to your gallant forces--soldiers, sailors, marines and air men from the United States and the other countries fighting for freedom under the United Nations banner. I salute you all, and say to all of you from all of us at home, \"Well and nobly done.\"\n\nHARRY S. TRUMAN",
