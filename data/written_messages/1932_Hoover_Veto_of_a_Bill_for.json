    "text": "To the Senate:\n\nI return herewith Senate Bill 2179, An Act for the relief of Alexander M. Proctor.\n\nI am advised that this bill would not operate to change the records of the War Department nor would it authorize the issue of a certificate of honorable discharge to Alexander M. Proctor, but that under its provisions Mr. Proctor would be entitled to a pension at the rate of $50 (maximum) per month under the act of March 3, 1927, known as the Indian War Pension Act. The relief appealed for by Mr. Proctor is for a change in his military record to an honorable discharge. This the bill does not accomplish. I am assured also that Mr. Proctor neither desires nor needs a pension. Therefore, I am returning the bill without my approval.\n\nHERBERT HOOVER The White House,\n\nFebruary 26, 1932.",
