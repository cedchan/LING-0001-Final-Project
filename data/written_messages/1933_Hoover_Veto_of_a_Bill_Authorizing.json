    "text": "To the Senate:\n\nI return herewith without approval--\n\nSenate 4340, An Act authorizing the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Oklahoma to hear and determine certain claims of the Seminole Nation or Tribe of Indians.\n\nThe tract of land therein described was formerly owned by the Seminole tribe of Indians in Oklahoma. It Was appraised and sold at public auction as provided by law. The full consideration was paid and title to the land has passed into the hands of a bona fide purchaser through transactions with the Government had in the utmost good faith. There is no substantial basis for thinking that Congress was without power to grant authority to the Secretary of the Interior to make the sale. There would seem to. be no justification for now authorizing a committee of the tribe to bring a harassing suit against a private owner who bought and paid for this property in good faith many years ago. Moreover this legislation might prove to be a precedent for private litigation affecting many other titles and large sums of money through other than the regular procedure. The rights of the Indians, if any, can be presented and adjudicated by the Court of Claims in the litigation pending before it under the Act of May 20, 1924.\n\nI attach hereto a letter from the Secretary of the Interior setting forth the views of the Department on the bill.\n\nHERBERT HOOVER The White House, January 30, 1933.",
