    "text": "Through you I wish to extend greetings to the businessmen of the Nation as represented by members of the United States Chamber of Commerce assembled in your annual meeting and War Council.\n\nOur form of Government, based as it is on a system of free enterprise, is meeting successfully the challenges of the totalitarian Governments. We are meeting the test because there is unity of purpose on the part of our people in all walks of life. In a democracy, difference of opinion as to methods of reaching an objective may be expected, but on the over-all task of defeating the Axis powers there is united determination.\n\nOnly by teamwork on the part of labor and management could we have reached the present high peak of production so essential to the successful prosecution of the war; our factories are now turning out munitions of war which in quantity and effectiveness far exceed the expectations of our enemies when they decided to make war upon us and our way of life.\n\nBut we are not satisfied. We must not be satisfied. More cooperation, more teamwork, and more production, all the way from the farms and mines through the assembly lines, will enable us to win the war more quickly.\n\nThe gains we are making in the production of war goods are the fruits of cooperation between management and employees in their devotion to a common cause. Members of the United States Chamber of Commerce may well be proud of the contribution they have made under your able leadership. I have had opportunity to know of and cause to appreciate that leadership.\n\nAmerican business is meeting the challenge of war and meeting it in a way that brings comfort to our people, and fear to our enemies.\n\nHonorable Eric Johnston, President, United States Chamber of Commerce.",
