    "text": "To the House of Representatives:\n\nI return herewith without my approval, H.R. 1128, entitled \"An Act authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to issue to Jake Alexander a patent in fee to certain lands in the State of Alabama.\"\n\nThis private bill authorizes and directs the Secretary of the Interior to convey without consideration to Jake Alexander 160 acres of unappropriated public lands withdrawn from entry as part of the William B. Bankhead National Forest, Alabama.\n\nI feel that this special legislation is unnecessary because cases of this kind can and should be taken care of under existing law. Public Law 159, 83rd Congress, broadened the Color of Title Act of December 22, 1928 specifically to cover claims similar to the one involved in H.R. 1128.\n\nA basic requirement of the Color of Title Act is payment to the United States of the appraised value of lands patented thereunder. In this respect I feel that H.R. 1128 would discriminate against the interest of the United States, as well as other color-of-title claimants, by exempting this particular claimant from payment of any consideration.\n\nDWIGHT D. EISENHOWER",
