The splendid cooperation of the press in the measures taken to stabilize the economic situation of the country has been of the highest value, and they can most usefully forward this work by continuing to express the justified optimism of American business, industry and agriculture over the outlook for steadily increasing employment and prosperity. Yours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
