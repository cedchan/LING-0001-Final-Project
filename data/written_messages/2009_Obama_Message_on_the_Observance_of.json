As they gather with their families and celebrate over meals, they welcome new beginnings and honor the enduring wisdom of their ancestors.\n\nFrom the lion dances in San Francisco to festivals in Atlanta and parades in New York City and Washington, DC, Americans of Asian descent carry on the vibrant traditions of their forefathers and enrich America's cultural diversity. I wish all those celebrating the New Year to be blessed with peace, prosperity, and good health.",
