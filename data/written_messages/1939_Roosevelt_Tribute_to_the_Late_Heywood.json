Mrs. Roosevelt joins me in this message.\n\nHeywood Broun lived a full life and leaves a noble heritage. His great gifts of heart and mind and soul were ever directed toward high purposes. Neither slander, nor calumny, nor thought of personal consequences ever deterred him once he had entered a fight in the cause of right and justice as he saw it.\n\nHe was a hard fighter but always a fair adversary and, no matter for whom he worked, he wore no man's collar. He will be missed and mourned, particularly by the underprivileged, whose staunch champion he always was.",
