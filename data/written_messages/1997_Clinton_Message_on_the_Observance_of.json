    "text": "Warm greetings to all those celebrating the sacred month of Ramadan.\n\nEach year during Ramadan, Muslims across America and around the world commemorate God's revelation of the Koran to Muhammad with a month of rigorous fasting and devout prayer. This period of discipline for body, mind, and spirit draws the Muslim community closer not only to God, but also to their fellow human beings.\n\nBy experiencing hunger during Ramadan, the followers of Muhammad learn true compassion for the poor of the world who go hungry every day. By reflecting on God's teachings in the Koran, they learn humility and the beauty of forgiveness. And, by their example of devotion and self-discipline during Ramadan, Muslims remind us all that our true strength is derived, not from food and drink, but from closeness to God.\n\nAs the crescent moon marks the beginning of Ramadan again this year, Hillary and I extend our best wishes for a holy and memorable observance.\n\nBILL CLINTON",
