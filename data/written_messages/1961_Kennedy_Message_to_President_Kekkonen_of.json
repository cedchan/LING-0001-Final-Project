Your nation, though small in size compared with many others, is peopled with lovers of freedom whose hearts are of giant proportion.\n\nAs you have journeyed through our land, I trust you have gained greater knowledge of our unrelenting determination. Americans are united in their resolve to meet with calmness and purpose the problems posed by forces which challenge not only the United States but indeed the whole community of nations sharing democratic institutions. We will never cease our efforts in pursuit of peace with justice for all mankind.\n\nAs you depart from our shores, please be assured of our continuing interest. in Finland's welfare, and of our awareness of the value of the shared ideals and bonds of friendship linking our countries. Sincerely,\n\nJOHN F. KENNEDY",
