In personal terms, I am especially impressed by your victory; only those who have devoted the hard work and years-long dedication to winning the presidency can fully appreciate what today's reaffirmation of the democratic process in France represents.\n\nTogether we face serious challenges to the security and well-being of our peoples and to the cause of peaceful progress worldwide. I am confident that the centuries-old tradition of Franco-American friendship, together with the democratic values our two nations deeply share, will enable us to meet these challenges and preserve the spirit of Western cooperation on which the constructive future of the world increasingly depends.\n\nI look forward to working closely with you and to the pleasure of meeting you in person. Sincerely,\n\nRONALD REAGAN",
