    "text": "To the Congress of the United States:\n\nI am pleased to transmit, as requested by section 4 of Public Law 94-110 of October 13, 1975, the Sixth Report of the United States Sinai Support Mission, describing operations of the U.S. early warning system in the Sinai Desert. The Mission's activities are an important part of the disengagement arrangements between Egypt and Israel concluded in September 1975.\n\nThe cost of operating the Sinai Support Mission during Fiscal Year 1978 was $11.7 million, about a half million dollars less than the amount appropriated. The estimated budget for Fiscal Year 1979 remains at $11.7 million.\n\nAt the request of the Subcommittee on Europe and the Middle East of the Committee on International Relations, House of Representatives, this report includes a brief review of the applicability of the United States early warning system concept to other areas of the Middle East. It concludes that the basic approach to early warning employed in the Sinai could be successful elsewhere, provided the parties directly concerned want and are willing to support it.\n\nTalks now under way in Washington between Egypt and Israel are likely to result in substantial changes in the United States' role in the Sinai. I will consult closely with the Congress as these and subsequent talks proceed, in order to insure that the peacekeeping efforts of the United States continue to advance the\n\ngoal of permanent peace in the Middle East.\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House, January 18, 1979.",
