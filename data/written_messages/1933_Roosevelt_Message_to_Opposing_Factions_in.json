    "text": "It is very heartening and a source of much satisfaction to me to know that the Cuban people now believe that a peaceful discussion of their country's problems is the most satisfactory means of determining their country's destinies, and that the best way of reconciling their political difficulties is to be found in the peaceable and orderly process of frank but constructive discussions.\n\nI wish the Cuban people every success in these discussions, for I am convinced that the restoration of political peace is a necessary and essential preliminary step on the way to Cuban economic recovery.\n\nThe representatives of all factions may rest assured that the moral support of the American people will be behind these attempts at the peaceable adjustment of Cuban problems through the orderly procedure of constitutional government.",
