One of the proudest traditions of our history is the early date at which our Nation committed itself unreservedly and permanently to the principle of freedom of conscience, and the very early action of Maryland in this respect was one of the important influences leading to the adoption of this principle. The strong support of the foremost Revolutionary patriots, including Washington, Jefferson, Franklin and many others, was decisive in fixing this principle in our Constitution as the permanent and beneficent policy of our country. Yours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
