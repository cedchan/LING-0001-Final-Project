Expeditious, regular settlement of business controversies within industry itself, by its own experts, is fundamental, but machinery is needed to make it effective. The American Arbitration Association provides a practical mechanism through which the method can be applied. I wish the fullest success to the business men meeting under the auspices of the Association to discuss this useful subject.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
