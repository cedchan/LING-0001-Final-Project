It proposes the site known as Chantilly, located partly in Loudoun County and partly in Fairfax County, Virginia, as the airport site which best meets the requirements of public safety, airport and airspace capacity, public service and cost.\n\nAccordingly, I recommend the selection of the Chantilly site, and at this site have directed the Civil Aeronautics Administration to proceed forthwith with the construction and development of a new public airport to serve the growing needs of the National Capital region.\n\nDWIGHT D. EISENHOWER",
