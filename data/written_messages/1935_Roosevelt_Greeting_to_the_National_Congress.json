I hope that your deliberations will result in stimulating the members of your organization to successful efforts in securing for all children in America the rights and privileges to which they are entitled.\n\nI congratulate you for your past achievements and wish for you a full measure of success in the future.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nMrs. B. F. Langworthy, President, National Congress of Parents and Teachers, Chicago, Illinois",
