    "text": "PERSONAL FEELING and personal responsibility of men to their neighbors is the soul of genuine goodwill; it is the essential foundation of modern society. A cold and distant charity which puts out its sympathy only through the tax collector yields a very meagre dole of unloving and perfunctory relief. The traditional American spirit of community solidarity in times of stress is admirably represented by volunteer organizations of citizens such as the Emergency Unemployment Relief Committee in New York City.",
