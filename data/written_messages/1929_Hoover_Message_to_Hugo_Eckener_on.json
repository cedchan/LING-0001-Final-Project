It has been a great adventure which again stirs the spirit and interest of all men and women. It marks another step in the progress of aviation. The German people are to be congratulated upon this evidence of their great contributions to the art and you are to be congratulated upon your courage and skill. Mr. Hearst, who I understand has importantly aided the trip financially, is also to be congratulated upon its outcome.",
