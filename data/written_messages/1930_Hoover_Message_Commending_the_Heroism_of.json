    "text": "My dear Mr. Harrison:\n\nI have noted with satisfaction the recognition of your heroism during the World War in standing by the mules and horses intrusted to your care, and protecting them at the expense of wounds and grave personal danger to yourself. Unselfish courage in helping a stricken comrade on the battle field is a soldierly quality that always inspires admiration; but your heroic action in risking your life to care for these dumb animals carries an added touch of unselfishness and devotion to duty, justifying a peculiar gratification among those who hold in high esteem the best traditions of our military service. Yours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
