    "text": "Dear Mr. Prime Minister:\n\nNow that the mission of Indian troops is drawing to a close in Korea, I want to express to you my appreciation and that of my countrymen for the performance of the Indian Custodial Forces.\n\nNo military unit in recent years has undertaken a more delicate and demanding peacetime mission than that faced by the Indian forces in Korea. The vast majority of prisoners placed in their charge had from months of imprisonment and uncertainty become highly nervous and volatile. The confidence inspired by the exemplary tact, fairness and firmness shown by the Indian officers and men led by their two able commanders, Lt. General Thimayya and Major General Thorat did much to alleviate the fears and doubts of these prisoners. The performance of these officers and their troops was fully in keeping with the high reputation of the Indian Army. They deserve the highest commendation.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\nSincerely,\n\nDWIGHT D. EISENHOWER",
