We condemned their captors for demonstrating a cynical contempt for international law and for Iran's own law\u2014and for undermining the fundamental commitment of all civilized nations to the settlement of disputes through peaceful means.\n\nWe will never forget the courage and strength of these fifty-two Americans and their families throughout the crisis. We are proud to commemorate today the safe return of these brave men and women.",
