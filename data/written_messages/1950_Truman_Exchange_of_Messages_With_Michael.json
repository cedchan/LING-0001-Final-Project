The people of the United States, and 'particularly the mothers of the United States, are deeply sensitive to the plight of these children and their bereaved families. We pray that the Governments of the countries harboring these children will be moved by a spirit of broad humanitarianism to cooperate in fulfilling the unanimous desire of the United Nations General Assembly that these children be promptly restored to their homes.\n\nHARRY S. TRUMAN",
