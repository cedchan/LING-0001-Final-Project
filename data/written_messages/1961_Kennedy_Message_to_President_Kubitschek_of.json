One of the cardinal objectives of my administration will be the association of the United States with the peoples of Latin America in a common effort to improve the lives of our peoples under the reign of liberty.\n\nMay I take this opportunity, Mr. President, to extend to you, as you leave the high office in which you have so faithfully served your country, my personal best wishes and those of the people and government of the United States of America, for your continued health and prosperity. Sincerely,\n\nJOHN F. KENNEDY",
