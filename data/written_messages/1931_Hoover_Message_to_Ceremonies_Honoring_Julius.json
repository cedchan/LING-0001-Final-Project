I regret that I was unable on account of the pressure of the public business, to accept your kind invitation to attend the presentation of the first of these awards on September 8th. I shall appreciate it if you will express my cordial good wishes to those gathered for the occasion and my hearty congratulations to Mr. Julius Rosenwald, the recipient of the premier award.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
