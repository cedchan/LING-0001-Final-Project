Department of Health, Education, and Welfare staff resources and time could be better spent on more research rather than on the preparation of annual reports of largely repetitious material. Basic information in this field has been known for some time, and new findings develop only slowly and infrequently. All of the information contained in this report is available to Congress during annual appropriations and oversight hearings, and the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare will inform Congress immediately of any scientific breakthroughs in the field.\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House, March 27, 1978.",
