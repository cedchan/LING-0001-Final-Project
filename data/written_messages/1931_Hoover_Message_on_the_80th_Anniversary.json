Our Government is and must be responsive to the will of the people expressed through considered public opinion. That expression is more guided and revealed through the press than any other agency, but it implies great responsibility on the press that the news shall be accurately presented without bias or color that the public may have an opportunity of formulating its views on the actual facts and that its expressed opinion shall be based upon considered and constructive editorial suggestions. Any newspaper, great or small, that accurately disseminates information aids in the promotion of good Government and in the sound development of the Nation. All these are truisms of self Government but vitally important. The New York Times has always been a conspicuous example of accurate reporting by impartial and far-flung news gathering facilities. The space it devotes to National and International affairs is a great and constructive contribution. The conscientiousness of its editorial expression is notable whether we agree with it or not. I wish to congratulate it on the observance of its eightieth anniversary. Yours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
