    "date": "1932-12-09",
    "text": "To the Senate and House of Representatives:\n\nThe Congress, on June 30, 1932, enacted provisions for the reorganization of the executive departments, which subject I have from time to time laid before the Congress.\n\nThe declared policy of the Congress, as set out in section 401 of title 4, part 2, of this act, follows:\n\n\"Sec. 401. In order to further reduce expenditures and increase efficiency in government it is declared to be the policy of Congress--\n\n\"(a) To group, coordinate, and consolidate executive and administrative agencies of the Government, as nearly as may be, according to major purpose;\n\n\"(b) To reduce the number of such agencies by consolidating those having similar functions under a single head;\n\n\"(c) To eliminate overlapping and duplication of effort; and\n\n\"(d) To segregate regulatory agencies and functions from those of an administrative and executive character.\"\n\nTo accomplish these purposes, the President was authorized by Executive order to transfer executive agencies to and from departments and independent executive agencies and to designate titles and duties of the officials connected therewith.\n\nThe act provides that such Executive orders must be transmitted to the Congress while in session and that they shall not become effective until the expiration of 60 calendar days, unless the Congress shall in the meantime approve them. In accordance with this authorization, I am transmitting herewith to the Congress Executive orders which have been issued to-day, transferring and grouping a large number of executive agencies.\n\nA further limitation was placed upon Executive action in the provision that statutory functions may not be abolished by Executive orders, the effect of which renders it necessary to retain many commissions, but, under the orders issued, their administrative functions are placed under various departments, the commissions retaining their advisory functions only. A total of 58 executive agencies and parts of agencies have been grouped or consolidated. One effect is to reduce by about 15 the number of independent agencies and commissions.\n\nI have made no estimate of the extent of the economies which will eventually result from this reorganization program. The total appropriations for the present fiscal year to these agencies is approximately $700,000,000.\n\nThese orders constitute the necessary initial action required in carrying out the policy which the Congress has proclaimed in connection with reorganization of the executive branch of the Federal Government. They undertake to group certain executive agencies and activities in logical and Orderly relation to each other as determined by their major functions and purposes, and to vest in the head of each department, subject to Executive approval, the authority and responsibility to develop and put into effect the ultimate details of better organization, elimination of overlap, duplication, and unnecessary expenditure. These results can only be worked out progressively by the executive officers placed in charge of the different divisions.\n\nAn example of the value of such grouping and consolidation is well shown in the increased efficiency and administrative economies brought about through the consolidation of agencies relating to veterans' service and likewise of enforcement activities which were authorized some time ago.\n\nI have under consideration further consolidations and grouping in the different departments, including certain functions of the Army and Navy, which I hope to be able to transmit to the Congress at a later date.\n\nPUBLIC WORKS\n\nI have established a Division of Public Works in the Department of the Interior and designated that the title of one of the present Assistant Secretaries shall be changed to \"Assistant Secretary of Interior for Public Works,\" under whose direction I have grouped the following organizations and functions:\n\n1.

Abolish the Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway Commission, whose powers and duties are transferred to the Department of the Interior. This commission has accomplished the purpose for which it was created and need no longer be retained as a separate entity.\n\n2. Transfer jurisdiction over the operation, protection, and maintenance of the parks, parkways, playgrounds, and recreational activities of the District of Columbia, from the Office of Public Buildings and Public Parks to the Commissioners of the District of Columbia, making it possible to consolidate and coordinate these activities with similar functions now performed by the Municipal Government of the District, and relieving the Federal Government of the control of activities which are purely local in character and which are paid for out of District of Columbia funds.\n\n3. Abolish the Employees' Compensation Commission. I have transferred those duties and activities of the commission which involve relations between private employers and their employees to the Department of Labor, and the remainder of its duties and activities, involving relations of the Federal Government and the Municipal Government of the District of Columbia, with their own employees, to the Civil Service Commission. This leaves no justification for the retention of the Employees' Compensation Commission.\n\n4. Abolish the Board of Trustees of the National Training School for Boys, and transfer the powers, duties, and functions of that board to the Board of Public Welfare of the District of Columbia. The practice of committing delinquent boys to this institution from jurisdictions outside of the District of Columbia has been generally discontinued. This will automatically convert it into a local reform school, the management of which should be entrusted to local authorities. A similar change in jurisdiction over the National Training School for Girls was made by an act approved March 16, 1926.\n\nI am submitting herewith not only Executive orders but also a brief discussion prepared by the Bureau of the Budget of the proposed transfers and the basis on which they are predicated.\n\nHERBERT HOOVER The White House, December 9, 1932.",
