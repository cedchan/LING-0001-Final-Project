I grew to know and share the emotions, hopes and dreams of the men, women and children of rural America. And every time I listen to Country music I am reminded of the timeless values by which they live.\n\nDuring this traditional observance, I want to salute Country music as the purest echo of rural America at work to help build the progress and well-being of our land.\n\nThis is why I welcome this opportunity to applaud the gifted artists who devote their finest talents to ensure our continued enjoyment of Country music and the dedicated fellow 'citizens who bring their performances to the widest possible audiences.\n\nJIMMY CARTER",
