    "text": "To the Senate of the United States:\n\nWith a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Protocol between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Canada to Amend the Convention for the Protection, Preservation and Extension of the Sockeye Salmon Fisheries in the Fraser River System, as Amended, signed at Washington on February 24, 1977. I also transmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Protocol.\n\nThe present Protocol increases the size of the Advisory Committee to the International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission from six members from each country to seven members from each country. The additional positions will enable the United States to provide for a native Indian adviser while continuing to have representatives on the Committee from all the presently represented parties.\n\nAn Indian adviser is particularly necessary at this time in light of recent court decisions dealing with Indian fishing rights. I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Protocol and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House,\n\nMarch 31, 1977.",
