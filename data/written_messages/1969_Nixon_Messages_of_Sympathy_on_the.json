We were all shocked to hear of the tragic and untimely death of your husband. His loss will be particularly felt by his countrymen, for whom he worked so hard. The memory of his brilliant leadership will, however, remain a source of inspiration and encouragement to all his friends, countrymen and fellow Americans.\n\nOur .thoughts are with you and your family and we pray God may now give you the same strength and courage that earned your husband the esteem of his countrymen.\n\nRICHARD NIXON\n\nDear Mr. President:\n\nOn behalf of my fellow countrymen, may I extend to you, Mr. President, and to the people of Bolivia our deepest sympathy for the untimely death of President Barrientos. A tragic accident has silenced a dynamic leader, and his loss will be deeply mourned by all who knew him. But the example of his leadership and his accomplishments will remain as a lasting legacy for all of his fellow Americans, and especially for his countrymen for whom he worked so hard. All who knew him are the richer for his memory, and Bolivia can be justly proud of his leadership and his life.\n\nRICHARD NIXON",
