Nevertheless, all men of good-will must press steadily toward that goal if civilization is to survive. In this forward march of the human spirit, poets lead the way with their visions of the ideal, and therefore you do well, in your memorial to Robert Burns, to stress his aspiration toward the time when \"Man to Man, the world o'er, shall brothers be.\"\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
