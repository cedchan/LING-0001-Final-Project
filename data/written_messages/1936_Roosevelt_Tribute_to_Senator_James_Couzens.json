    "text": "In the death of Senator Couzens the Senate of the United States and the people of Michigan and the Nation have lost a leader whose convictions were a part of the best that America aspires for and whose courage was a match for his idealism.\n\nSenator Couzens did not enter public life because he sought either fame or power, but rather because of a service he believed he could render to the cause of progressive thought and political uprightness. He was a party member. But his prior obligation was to the well-being of the people whom he served. He never hesitated in that service.\n\nThe death of Senator Couzens to me is a great loss. But, more than that, it is a great loss to the multitudes of Americans whose needs and problems were always in the forefront of his thought and action.",
