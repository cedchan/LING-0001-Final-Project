The Pilgrimage to Paris for the purpose of dedicating a bronze tablet bearing these names, upon the 151st anniversary of the Battle of Yorktown, is a splendid gesture of appreciation, certain to promote an historic international friendship and coming with especial appropriateness from your great group of patriotic American women. Yours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
