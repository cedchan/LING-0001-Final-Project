This, understandably, is a source of great pride and satisfaction to all who have dedicated themselves to making the United Nations an effective instrument of world peace and progress and I am confident that in the years to come your country will strengthen the ranks of those devoted to this noble purpose\n\nThe Government and people of the United States welcome the independence of your country and look forward to a lasting friendship with your Government and people. Sincerely,\n\nDWIGHT D. EISENHOWER",
