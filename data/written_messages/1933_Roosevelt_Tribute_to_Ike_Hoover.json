    "text": "As a young man during the Administration of President Theodore Roosevelt it was my good fortune to know Ike Hoover. The affection of those days lived through later years.\n\nIt was Ike who met me at the door when I came to make the White House my home. It was good to receive his welcome and during these months to have his help and devotion in official and family life.\n\nIn common with all others who knew him, his passing is a tremendous personal loss. All of our family are deeply distressed.\n\nThe Nation, too, has lost a true and faithful public servant who, during every Administration since that of President Harrison, has given of his best to his Government.",
