    "text": "ON NOVEMBER 7, 1941, I addressed a letter to His Excellency President Kalinin in which I congratulated him upon the national anniversary of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and expressed the admiration of the people of the United States for the \"valiant and determined resistance of the Army and people of the Soviet Union\" and the determination of the United States that the \"sacrifices and sufferings of those who have the courage to struggle against aggression will not have been in vain.\"\n\nIn that letter I assured President Kalinin \"of the desire of the Government and people of the United States to do everything possible to assist your country in this critical hour.\"\n\nIn accordance with that pledge and pursuant to the power conferred upon me by the Lend-Lease Act, I have today found that the defense of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is vital to the defense of the United States. I therefore authorize and direct you to take immediate action to transfer defense supplies to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics under the Lend-Lease Act and to carry out the terms of my letter of October 30, 1941, to Premier Stalin.\n\nI should appreciate it if you would work out as quickly as possible details of this program with representatives of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.",
