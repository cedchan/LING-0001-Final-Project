As your song goes, \"For Dolly will never go away again.\"\n\nLYNDON B. JOHNSON\n\nTo Mary Martin .\n\nYou are a front-line patriot in the work you are doing. You're making your President and all of Wetherford, Texas, deeply proud of you. Lady Bird and I send you our warm affections.\n\nLYNDON BAINES JOHNSON",
