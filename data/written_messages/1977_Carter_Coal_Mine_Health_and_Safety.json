HEW staff resources and time could be better spent on more research rather than on the preparation of annual reports of largely repetitious material. Basic information in this field has been known for some time, and new findings develop only slowly and infrequently. All of the information contained in this report is available to Congress during annual appropriations and oversight hearings, and HEW will inform Congress immediately of any scientific break-throughs in the field.\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House, March 8, 1977.",
