It also includes the Administration's new economic assumptions.\n\nBecause of the uncertainty over 1996 appropriations as well as possible changes in mandatory programs and tax policy, the Office of Management and Budget was not able to provide, by today, all of the material normally contained in the President's budget submission. I anticipate transmitting that material to Congress the week of March 18, 1996.\n\nWilliam J. Clinton",
