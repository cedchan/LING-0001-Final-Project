I should like to emphasize the great contribution your service has given for the advancement of good will in our relations with our sister republics to the south. By the enlargement of your news services you have contributed to better understanding not by preachments but by the daily illustration of the wholesome side of our national life. You have stimulated commercial relations with more ample commercial service. It is, therefore, most appropriate that your guest of honor should be His Excellency the President-elect of Colombia who so ably represented his country in Washington, and I would be pleased if you would convey my compliments to him.\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
