    "text": "To the Senate of the United States:\n\nI transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate, the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, done at London on November 2, 1973, together with Annexes I and II thereof, and two related Protocols. The report of the Department of State is enclosed for the information of the Senate.\n\nThe Convention is one of the most important maritime environmental protection measures ever completed. It deals comprehensively with operational discharges from vessels, establishes strict controls over oil discharges, and imposes regulations for discharges of other pollutants. It also creates standards for the construction and design of ships which will carry these hazardous cargoes.\n\nI feel that entry into force of this Convention will be an important step in controlling and preventing pollution from vessel discharges. I recommend that the Senate give early consideration to the Convention and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House, March 22, 1977.",
