    "text": "To the Congress of the United States:\n\nConsistent with section 6001(a) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) (the \"Act\"), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6961(a), notification is hereby given that on September 20, 1999, I issued Presidential Determination 99- 37 (copy enclosed) and thereby exercised the authority to grant certain exemptions under section 6001(a) of the Act.\n\nPresidential Determination 99-37 exempted the United States Air Force's operating location near Groom Lake, Nevada, from any Federal, State, interstate, or local hazardous or solid waste laws that might require the disclosure of classified information concerning that operating location to unauthorized persons. Information concerning activities at the operating location near Groom Lake has been properly determined to be classified, and its disclosure would be harmful to national security. Continued protection of this information is, therefore, in the paramount interest of the United States.\n\nThe determination was not intended to imply that in the absence of a Presidential exemption, RCRA or any other provision of law permits or requires the disclosure of classified information to unauthorized persons. The determination also was not intended to limit the applicability or enforcement of any requirement of law applicable to the Air Force's operating location near Groom Lake except those provisions, if any, that would require the disclosure of classified information.\n\nWILLIAM J. CLINTON\n\nThe White House, January 31, 2000.",
