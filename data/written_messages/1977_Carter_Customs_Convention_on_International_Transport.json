    "text": "To the Senate of the United States: With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the revised Customs Convention on the International Transport of Goods under cover of Transport International Routier Carnets (TIR Convention), done at Geneva on November 14, 1975. I also transmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the Convention.\n\nThe revised TIR Convention is based on the TIR Convention of 1959 to which the United States is a party. The revised TIR Convention contains modernized technical provisions which will facilitate transportation of United States goods. The most important improvements are that the TIR Carnet is now to be printed in English as well as French, and United States goods transported to Europe which arrive late under the TIR Carnet will be protected against administrative delays.\n\nI recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Convention and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House, July 26, 1977.",
