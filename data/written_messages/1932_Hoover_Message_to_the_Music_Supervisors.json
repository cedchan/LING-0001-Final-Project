    "text": "I will be obliged if you will express my cordial greetings to the delegates at the silver anniversary meeting of the Music Supervisors National Conference and my sense of the great cultural importance of their work in the life of the people of the United States. The almost universal love of music and the frequent possession of musical talent among our children makes training in music not only valuable from an educational standpoint, but increases the capacity of all to appreciate music and thereby adds vastly to the sum of human happiness. The self-discipline required for musical practice, calling for painstaking care and complete accuracy, is as important to child development as other forms of educational training. It has also a social value flowing out of the cooperative work in orchestra, bands and choruses. A distinct enrichment in American life will follow from added devotion on the part of our boys and girls to the beautiful art of music. Yours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER [Mr. Russell V. Morgan, President, Music Supervisors National Conference, Board of Education Bldg., Cleveland, Ohio]",
