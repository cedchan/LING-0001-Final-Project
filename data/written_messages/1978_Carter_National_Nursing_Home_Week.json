    "text": "We must not forget our older Americans who have contributed so much to the growth and development of our society. The nursing home must reflect our appreciation and our unfailing concern for their well-being.\n\nOn behalf of a grateful nation, I therefore want to pay tribute to the many dedicated individuals who provide services to these in nursing homes. New knowledge about the elderly, new technology and improved skills have resulted in the saving of human life, the prolongation of the life span and the rehabilitation of the impaired and disabled. This noteworthy progress calls for a stronger than ever commitment by all of us to the health and well-being of our increasing numbers of citizens in their golden years. I know we will not fail them, and I ask all Americans to join in the spirit of this observance.\n\nJIMMY CARTER",
