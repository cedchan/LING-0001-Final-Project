May I add that I hope those Members from States whose Governors have set November thirtieth as Thanksgiving Day will celebrate both Thanksgivings\u2014the twenty-third and the thirtieth.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nThe Honorable The Vice President of the United States, United States Senate, Washington, D.C.",
