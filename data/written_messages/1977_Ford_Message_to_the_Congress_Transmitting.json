I urge that the Congress give favorable consideration to this Agreement at an early date. Since 60 calendar days of continuous session as required by the legislation are not available before March 1, 1977, I strongly recommend that the Senate consider issuance of a joint resolution with the House of Representatives in order to bring this Agreement into force by that date.\n\nGERALD R. FORD The White House, January 10, 1977.",
