We can also find comfort in the continuing efforts of all the organizations and individuals responsible for guiding and developing programs to assist those with hearing, speech or language impediments. By promoting community activities relating to improved health, rehabilitation and social care, you are performing a vital public service.\n\nI urge more Americans to volunteer their time and energy to this worthwhile cause.\n\nJIMMY CARTER",
