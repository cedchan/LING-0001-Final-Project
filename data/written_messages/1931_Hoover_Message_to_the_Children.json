The Children's Charter, which it promulgated, sets forth the aspirations and objectives of those who are seeking the protection and the rounded development of the children of America.\n\nI enclose a copy of the Children's Charter, which states succinctly the rights of children, regardless of race or color or situation, wherever they may live under the protection of the American flag. Yours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
