    "text": "Dear Mr. Greve:\n\nI have noticed with interest the day-by-day accounts of the National Air Race event now being held in Cleveland, and for which the City of Cleveland has made such elaborate preparation. It is indeed gratifying to observe that the American people are so greatly interested in the progress of aeronautics. I trust that this interest, not only in the present accomplishments of air-craft and air transportation but in the future possibilities as well, will serve to sustain in increasing measure our airmen, our manufacturers, and all others who are putting forth their best efforts to keep America first in the air. Yours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
