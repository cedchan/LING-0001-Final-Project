This Administration is studying ways to improve the workplace safety and health efforts of all Federal agencies, including those programs that affect Federal employees. I intend that reports covering the years of this Administration will reflect significant progress in that regard.\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House, June 2, 1978.",
