We should continue this cooperation to the fullest possible extent in combating the scourge of drug abuse.\n\nAfter a survey by a special task force on the contribution of the Convention to the control of illegal international drug traffic, I have concluded that the national and international interest in drug control will be significantly advanced by United States accession.\n\nI recommend that the Senate give the Convention early and favorable consideration.\n\nLYNDON B. JOHNSON The White House March 8, 1967",
