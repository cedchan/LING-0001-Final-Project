    "date": "1980-05-09",
    "text": "To the Senate of the United States:\n\nI transmit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to ratification, the Food Aid Convention, 1980, adopted by a conference of Governments at London on March 6, 1980, and open for signature in Washington from March 11 through April 30, 1980. The report of the Department of State is enclosed for the information of the Senate in connection with its consideration of the Convention.\n\nThe Convention replaces the Food Aid Convention, 1971, and together with the Wheat Trade Convention, 1971, constitutes the International Wheat Agreement.\n\nThe new Convention commits an increased number of members to provide greater minimum annual quantities of food aid to developing countries. The United States commitment is 4,470,000 metric tons, as compared with a commitment of 1,890,000 metric tons under the 1971 Convention. Either amount is well within the limits provided for by the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954, P.L. 480, at least through FY 1980. Implementing legislation is therefore unnecessary unless the FY 1981 P.L. 480 budget proves insufficient. The Convention also provides for the consideration of increased food aid during a period of production shortfall in developing countries. However, increased food aid contributions by members would be voluntary, not mandatory.\n\nThe Convention will enter into force on July 1, 1980, if by June 30, 1980, the 11 members referred to in Article III have accepted it in accordance with its terms. It will remain in force for one year, provided that the Wheat Trade Convention, 1971, or a new convention replacing it, remains in force for that period. If the Wheat Trade Convention is extended, this Convention may be similarly extended.\n\nI hope that the Senate will give early and favorable consideration to the Food Aid Convention, 1980, so that ratification by the United States can be effected at an early date. Doing so will demonstrate our continued commitment to providing food aid to needy developing nations.\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House, May 9, 1980.",
