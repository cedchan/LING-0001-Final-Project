    "text": "When our people in any section of the country are faced with the perils and suffering which follow so swiftly in the wake of disaster, they look with one accord to the American Red Cross for instant and efficient relief. They have never looked in vain.\n\nThose of us who are willing to lend a helping hand in time of emergency to others less fortunate than ourselves look to this great national relief agency as our representative in the hour of need. It does not disappoint us. It is an historic institution closely allied with your Government, and its President is always the President of the United States.\n\nJust now the Red Cross is asking every adult American to lend his or her support to Red Cross service through individual memberships. The record of the Red Cross is one we may all be proud of. In the past year sufferers of one hundred and seventeen disasters have been cared for. Five million families have benefited by distribution of relief materials. A million Americans have served as volunteers under the Red Cross banner.\n\nI earnestly urge you to respond most generously to the annual Red Cross roll call. We must do our part to keep the Red Cross ready, day or night, for service.",
