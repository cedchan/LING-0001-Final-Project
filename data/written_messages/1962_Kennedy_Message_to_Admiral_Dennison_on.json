    "text": "TEN YEARS AGO today the Headquarters of the Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic was established at Norfolk, Virginia. This Headquarters, a part of NATO, is the only international military headquarters ever set up in peacetime on this continent. It has quietly and efficiently carried out the vital work of training allied naval forces for their wartime task. Their mission to provide security of the North Atlantic Ocean and North Sea area is vital to us and our allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\nA most striking feature of this international staff is the cooperation and teamwork that exists and which characterizes the resolute will of the NATO countries to resist any encroachment on their freedom.\n\nI extend my best wishes on this Tenth Anniversary Day to the Allied Command Atlantic.\n\nJOHN F. KENNEDY",
