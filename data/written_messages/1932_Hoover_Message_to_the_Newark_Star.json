The celebration of an event of this kind in the life of any city is worthy of special notice. This is particularly true, I believe, in the case of Newark, where the Star-Eagle has so long so notably served the interests of a rapidly growing cosmopolitan American community.\n\nI wish to offer my felicitations to you and to express the hope that the Star-Eagle will long continue to parallel the city's growth with its contributions to the public welfare. Yours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
