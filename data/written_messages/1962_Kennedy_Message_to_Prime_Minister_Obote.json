    "text": "Dear Mr. Prime Minister:\n\nI congratulate you and your people upon Uganda's independence. The government and the people of the United States wish Uganda a prosperous future as a sovereign nation.\n\nThe principle of self-determination in Africa has in Uganda proved once more its truth and strength. This principle inspired our own people in their struggle for independence, and we therefore feel a special kinship and pride in welcoming Uganda to the community of free nations.\n\nA common devotion to the United Nations Charter will strongly bind our nations in the imperative task of building a just and peaceful world. Uganda's independence strengthens the forces working toward this goal. Sincerely,\n\nJOHN F. KENNEDY",
