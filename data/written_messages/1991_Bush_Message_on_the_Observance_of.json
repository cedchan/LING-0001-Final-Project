    "text": "I am pleased to extend my warmest greetings to everyone celebrating the Chinese Lunar New Year of the Ram, 4689.\n\nThis holiday provides a wonderful opportunity for you to join with family and friends in celebrating the past and in looking ahead to the challenges and opportunities that the new year will bring. However, on this special occasion, it is also fitting that all Americans pause to recognize the many lasting contributions Chinese Americans have made to our country.\n\nAmerica owes a debt of gratitude to the many ethnic groups that have helped to shape the character of our Nation. Sharing a rich and diverse heritage, Americans of Chinese descent have long been recognized for their many contributions to America's social, cultural, and economic development. Today, by striving to uphold virtues celebrated during the Year of the Ram -- patience, self-sacrifice, and consideration for others -- you continue to enrich our communities and our country.\n\nBarbara and I send our best wishes for every happiness in the Year of the Ram. God bless you.\n\nGeorge Bush",
