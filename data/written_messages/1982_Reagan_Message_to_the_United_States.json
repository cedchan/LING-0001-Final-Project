The conditions under which you carry out your vital assignment are, I know, demanding and potentially dangerous. You are tasked to be once again what Marines have been for more than 200 years\u2014peacemakers. Your role in the multi-national force\u2014along with that of your French and Italian counterparts\u2014is crucial to achieving the peace that is so desperately needed in this long-tortured city.\n\nI expect that you will perform with the traditional esprit and discipline for which the Marine Corps is renowned. Godspeed.\n\nRONALD REAGAN",
