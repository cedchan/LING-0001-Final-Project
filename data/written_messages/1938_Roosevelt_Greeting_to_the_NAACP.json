For it is evident that no democracy can long survive which does not accept as fundamental to its very existence the recognition of the rights of its minorities.\n\nI wish you a most successful meeting.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nMr. Walter White, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Columbus, Ohio.",
