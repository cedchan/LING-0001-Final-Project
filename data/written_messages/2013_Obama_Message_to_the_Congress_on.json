    "text": "To the Congress of the United States:\n\nSection 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency, unless, within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13396 of February 7, 2006, with respect to the situation in or in relation to C\u00f4te d'Ivoire is to continue in effect beyond February 7, 2013.\n\nThe situation in or in relation to C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, which has been addressed by the United Nations Security Council in Resolution 1572 of November 15, 2004, and subsequent resolutions, has resulted in the massacre of large numbers of civilians, widespread human rights abuses, significant political violence and unrest, and fatal attacks against international peacekeeping forces. Since the inauguration of President Alassane Ouattara in May 2011, the Government of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire has made progress in advancing democratic freedoms and economic development. While the Government of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and its people continue to make progress towards peace and prosperity, the situation in or in relation to C\u00f4te d'Ivoire continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. For these reasons, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency and related measures blocking the property of certain persons contributing to the conflict in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire.\n\nBARACK OBAMA\n\nThe White House,\n\nFebruary 4, 2013.",
