It is fitting that all Americans pause to reflect on their splendid service.\n\nNo nation has been more committed to peace than America, and no Americans have done more to achieve a lasting peace than the members of our Armed Forces, past and present. They represent the spirit that has made and preserved us as a nation.\n\nRICHARD NIXON",
