But some Americans can also be thankful for the knowledge that they have given--that they have contributed to the sum of this Nation's blessings.\n\nNone have contributed more to America than our servicemen. All of us have enjoyed freedom, but you have stood ready to fight for it--you have protected it. And so, in this special time when we give thanks to God, we give thanks to you as well for helping to preserve what God has given us.\n\nMrs. Nixon and I extend our warmest wishes to each of you on this Thanksgiving Day and throughout the year.",
