It has seen Nigeria take its place with distinction among the family of free nations. It has seen the emergence of wise and far-reaching plans for the social and economic betterment of the Nigerian people. In essence, it has been a period in which firm foundations have been laid for the future of a great nation. The people of the United States join me in the hope that the peace and prosperity of this first year will continue and that the succeeding anniversaries of Nigeria's independence will be equally happy and fruitful. Sincerely,\n\nJOHN F. KENNEDY [His Excellency, The Governor General, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Lagos, Nigeria]",
