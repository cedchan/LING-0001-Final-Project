It is the wise provision against future needs.\n\nProvision against future needs involves savings and wise spending for insurance, home ownership and many other constructive, sensible and discriminating actions. Thrift Week, appropriately beginning Benjamin Franklin's birthday, January 17th, can contribute to the nation of these concepts. I trust that it may help to realize these and necessary objectives. Yours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
