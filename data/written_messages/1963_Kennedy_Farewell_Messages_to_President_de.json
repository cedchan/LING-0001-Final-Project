Your gracious wife taught me the Irish word for welcome, \"failte.\" I did not know \"failte\" could mean as much as you and the Irish people have made it mean for me during the past four days. I will have the memory of this wonderful Irish welcome in my heart always.\n\nJOHN F. KENNEDY\n\nTo Taoiseach Sean F. Lemass:\n\nI would like through you, Mr. Lemass, to thank all of the Irish people who have made my visit such a memorable one. The wonderful hospitality I have been showered with has indeed made me feel that I had \"come home.\"\n\nMeeting so many of the Irish people and their leaders was particularly enjoyable and I have been gratified by their sympathetic understanding of the problems which we in the West face.\n\nI should like you to know how much I have enjoyed the personal exchange of views and ideas I have had with you. From the bottom of my heart, God bless Ireland.\n\nJOHN F. KENNEDY",
