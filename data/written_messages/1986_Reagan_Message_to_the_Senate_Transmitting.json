    "text": "To the Senate of the United States:\n\nI transmit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to ratification, the Convention between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Tunisian Republic for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (referred to hereafter as \"the Convention\"), together with a related exchange of notes, signed at Washington on June 17, 1985. I also transmit the report of the Department of State on the Convention.\n\nThe Convention is the first income tax treaty to be negotiated between the United States and Tunisia. It is based on model income tax treaties developed by the Department of the Treasury, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and the United Nations. It deviates in some respects from the models to reflect Tunisia's status as a developing country and an importer of capital.\n\nThe Convention provides rules with respect to the taxation of various types of income, such as business profits, personal service income, and investment income. It also contains standard provisions guaranteeing a foreign tax credit, ensuring nondiscriminatory tax treatment, and providing for exchanges of information and administrative cooperation to avoid double taxation and prevent tax evasion.\n\nI recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Convention, together with the related exchange of notes, and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n\nRONALD REAGAN The White House, March 13, 1986.",
