The work of these foreign trade conventions is an example of sound cooperative leadership and is of outstanding value at this juncture. It is especially appropriate that our foreign traders meet with our friends and neighbors from Canada and across the Pacific Ocean to devise means of coordination in the great enterprise of international trade. At the cross-roads of the Pacific, with whose shores the destiny of mankind is becoming each year increasingly concerned, your service to American foreign trade will be notably advanced by this important meeting.\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
