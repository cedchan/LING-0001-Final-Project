Daily our laboratories are engaged in the pursuit of newer knowledge which will make constantly more effective the unending combat against illness and disease. The pharmacists of our country are indispensable allies of the physicians. It is fitting, therefore, that each year we should formally acknowledge our indebtedness to them. I am glad to extend to the pharmacists of the Nation the good wishes of all our people.\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
