The debt which this country and indeed the whole world owes to Mr. Edison is everywhere recognized, but in this universal acclaim let us not forget the fine and admirable character, the lofty soul of the man to whom we owe so much. Here also is a source of pride to all Americans.\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
