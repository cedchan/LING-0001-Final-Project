You are engaged in a most worthy undertaking when you seek to bridge the difficulties raised by the difference in language, customs, and conceptions of public problems, and assist the very valuable immigrant stock of Germanic origin in this country to adjust themselves to their new loyalties, and to give in largest measure their contribution of industry, idealism, and public spirit to the service of our country. Yours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
