I am grateful for the expressions of good will which it contained.\n\nI have a profound interest in the welfare of the Virgin Islands and sincerely hope that conditions may improve. The reports of Governor Pearson indicate an increasing determination on the part of the people of the islands to help themselves and cooperate with the Federal government in its efforts to carry out the rehabilitation program which has been adopted by Congress and is now under way. Only through such spirit of self-help and cooperation can permanent improvement be achieved. The best citizens of any community are those who strive to make themselves economically independent and at the same time are interested in the improvement of conditions generally. Yours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
