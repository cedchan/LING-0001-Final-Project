    "text": "To the Senate of the United States:\n\nWith a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the Treaty between the United States of America and the United Mexican States on the Execution of Penal Sentences which was signed in Mexico City on November 25, 1976.\n\nI transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report by the Department of State with respect to the Treaty.\n\nThe Treaty would permit citizens of either nation who had been convicted in the courts of the other country to serve their sentences in their home country; in each case the consent of the offender as well as the approval of the authorities of the two governments would be required.\n\nThis Treaty is significant because it represents an attempt to resolve a situation which has inflicted substantial hardships on a number of citizens of each country and has caused considerable concern to both governments. It received the approval of the Senate of the United Mexican States on December 30, 1976. I recommend that the Senate give favorable consideration to this Treaty at an early date.\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House,\n\nFebruary 15, 1977.",
