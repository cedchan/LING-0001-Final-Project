For a year and a half the officers and enlisted men of the Battalion have toiled in the tropical jungle in the accomplishment of this task. Their work has been done, not for financial reward, but in that willing and faithful performance of duty which is the tradition of the Army, in peace and in war. I should be pleased to have you convey to these troops my appreciation of their devoted service.\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
