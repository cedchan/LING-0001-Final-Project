Our efforts have yielded important benefits to cities, urban counties and their residents. It is my hope that this Executive Summary, and the full Biennial Report on which it is based, will help us define this nation's urban policy agenda for the 1980's.\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House, September 22, 1980.",
