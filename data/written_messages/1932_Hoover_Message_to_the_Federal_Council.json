I deeply regret that the pressure of public business connected with the opening of the session of the Congress makes it impossible for me to command the time for such a service.\n\nI will be obliged if you will convey to the meeting the assurance of my very high regard for the Federal Council and its purposes in our life. I especially appreciate and commend the wise and hearty cooperation on the part of the churches in the promotion of social service, better relations and the creation of that spiritual and ethical tone so absolutely essential to our life as a people. Yours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
