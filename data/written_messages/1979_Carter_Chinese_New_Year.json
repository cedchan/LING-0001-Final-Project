It is a time when family quarrels are forgotten and when doors and windows are left open to give access to any beneficent spirits that may be passing.\n\nThis tradition takes on a special significance this year as the American and Chinese people build new ties of friendship and mutual cooperation.\n\nLet Americans of Chinese ancestry and, indeed, all our citizens join in a special New Year's prayer that this relationship will blossom for the benefit of all Chinese and American people and of all nations.\n\nRosalynn and I welcome this opportunity to express our warmest New Year wishes to all Chinese Americans. May this Year of the Ram be remembered for having strengthened the structure of peace and fulfilled the hopes of all mankind for a more tranquil, prosperous and satisfying life.\n\nJIMMY CARTER",
