In the period from January nineteen hundred thirty to the end of the current fiscal year the Federal Government is expending over four hundred thirty-nine million dollars for highway building as a part of its total expenditures of more than one billion, five hundred fifty-five million dollars for construction and maintenance in aid of unemployment since the depression began. Road building by the Federal Government and the States and municipalities is a major factor in unemployment relief. Your Association has performed a very useful function in coordinating engineering, manufacturing, equipment and industrial aspects of the program. I trust that your convention may be fruitful in sound plans and policies of such an important factor, both of relief and recovery.\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
