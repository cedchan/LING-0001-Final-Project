These extraordinary achievements have required great sacrifice.\n\nOn this day of remembrance, we pause to reflect on the Apollo 1, Challenger , and Columbia crews, as well as others who lost their lives supporting NASA's mission of exploration and study of the Earth, the planets, and the stars. All of humanity has benefited from their courage and devotion.\n\nWe mourn their loss while celebrating their spirit of discovery. May their sacrifice be an inspiration as we continue our Nation's work to explore our universe.",
