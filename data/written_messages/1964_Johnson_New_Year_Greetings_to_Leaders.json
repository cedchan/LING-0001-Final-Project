    "text": "Dear Mr. Chairmen:\n\nPersonally, and on behalf of the American people, I extend to you and the Soviet people greetings and best wishes for the New Year.\n\nThe year just ending has produced significant accomplishment in some areas of endeavor. But major international problems are unresolved and the most urgent business for all of us remains strengthening the foundation of world peace. In this task, our two governments bear great responsibilities and it is my earnest wish that in the coming year we can make substantial progress.\n\nArms control remains especially urgent; nothing can contribute more to the hopes of mankind for the future. During the months ahead I hope we can work for practical agreements to this end. We can and should move to limit the spread of nuclear weapons; to achieve a verified worldwide comprehensive test ban; to make a cut-off of fissionable material production for weapons coupled with measures to safeguard the peaceful uses of nuclear power; and to agree on a verified freeze in existing offensive and defensive strategic nuclear delivery systems.\n\nBy progress in this critical area, our governments can help to make this a happier and safer world for all peoples. You may be certain that the American people and their government will never be second in this effort. Sincerely yours,\n\nLYNDON B. JOHNSON",
