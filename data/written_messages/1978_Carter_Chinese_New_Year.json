Time-honored Chinese wisdom has given us inspiration, Chinese art has enriched our lives and individuals of Chinese origin have immeasurably contributed to the vitality and strength of our society.\n\nFor all these reasons this New Year observance makes it highly appropriate for us to salute all Chinese-Americans on whom so much of our national progress and development continues to depend.\n\nJIMMY CARTER",
