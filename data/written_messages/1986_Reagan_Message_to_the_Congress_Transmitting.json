This is also the first biennial report, covering the years 1983 and 1984.\n\nContinued strong support for our Nation's science and technology has been and will continue to be a policy of this Administration. The goals of this support are enhanced national security, improved quality of life, and increased industrial competitiveness. Today, more than ever before, we must use our technological resources aggressively in order to retain international leadership. This report highlights recent achievements in federally supported science and technology. It also presents areas of major emphasis for Federal action as we move forward in the coming years. Our challenge for the future is to draw upon our unique strength in basic science and accelerate the development of technology and products that will benefit our society.\n\nRONALD REAGAN The White House, January 22, 1986.",
