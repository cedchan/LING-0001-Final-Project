    "text": "Today marks a major milestone in the defense of our nation. The introduction of the F-22 Raptor air superiority fighter culminates over 10 years of dedicated hard work by thousands of people across the country, the vision and long-range planning of congressional leaders, and the leadership of three Presidents. But perhaps more than anything else, it is proof positive of the know-how and can-do spirit of America's most valuable asset\u2014the American work force.\n\nToday's ceremony is more than just the \"rollout\" of a new fighter aircraft. It is a tribute to the American worker and testimony to the skill, training, and dedication of our people. Across 46 states and in hundreds of companies, large and small, these men and women have come together to produce this catalyst for a revolution in air power. I'm proud to salute all those who have gathered for this event and to wish everyone associated with the F-22 much success as it moves into the flight test phase of its development program.\n\nBILL CLINTON",
