But the result of their sacrifice, and of the service of all their comrades-in-arms, is beyond price: We are a nation; we are united; we are free.\n\nOn Memorial Day 1968, we yearn for an end to war, for a time when the guns will be silenced forever and men can live as they wish.\n\nThat peace, when it comes, will be the lasting memorial of all who have fought to give it birth, and whose service and sacrifice we honor today.",
