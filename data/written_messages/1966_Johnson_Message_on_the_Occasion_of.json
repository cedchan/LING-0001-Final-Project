    "text": "IT IS my great pleasure to extend best wishes through Averell Harriman to the Americans of German descent who today honor the memory of Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben.\n\nGeneral von Steuben was among the first in an illustrious line of Germans whose devotion to the cause of liberty led them to these shores. More than eight million Germans followed him and helped to build our Nation.\n\nThe descendents of these men and women strengthen our economic and political life, enlarge our culture and advance our science.\n\nWe are honored that the German Vice Chancellor, Mr. Eric Mende, is with you in New York. His government has just made another German contribution to American culture--a large gift to the Metropolitan Opera. Because of this gift, New York will have better music. This is fitting, as it adds to the countless gifts of music that America and the world have received from the German spirit and genius. I wish you all well.\n\nLYNDON B. JOHNSON",
