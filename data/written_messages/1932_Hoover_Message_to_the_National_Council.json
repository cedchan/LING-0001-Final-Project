The fact that you have notwithstanding unusual handicaps, been able to achieve such substantial progress in making your program available to an increased number of boys in response to the challenge which I gave to your Organization on the occasion of your meeting here in Washington in March 1930, is further evidence of the strength and vitality of Scouting in America. This is a great tribute to your leaders and especially to those who serve as Scoutmasters. Please convey to your leaders assembled for your Twenty-Second Annual Meeting and through them to your membership of now over nine hundred thousand men and boys my greetings and good wishes. It is highly important, particularly in these times, that the support of the public be maintained for our educational, social and character-building agencies and I am confident that your fine record will contribute to this end.\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
