It was a pleasure to see you here and have the opportunity for extended personal discussions on matters of greatest importance to both our countries. I greatly value the close relationship that has developed between our governments, and it is a great advantage to us that we are able to deal with our common problems and purposes in these meetings with such cordial and open intimacy. I feel that this is the best and most helpful meeting we have had. I am grateful to you for coming and we are all proud to have had a chance to show again the regard America has for a great defender of freedom.\n\nMrs. Kennedy joins me in sending warmest regards to you and your daughter, Frau Werhahn.\n\nJOHN F. KENNEDY",
