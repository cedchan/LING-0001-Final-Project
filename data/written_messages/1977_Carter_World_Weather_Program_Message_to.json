    "text": "To the Congress of the United States:\n\nThe memory of the severe winter of 1976-1977 in the eastern United States and its effects on our people and the national economy is still fresh in our minds. The continuing drought in the western United States is affecting not only agriculture and power generation but even basic community water supplies. Droughts, floods and freezes in the USSR, the African Sahel, the Indian subcontinent and Brazil in recent years have unsettled world markets and inflicted misery and often death upon untold numbers of people.\n\nSenate Concurrent Resolution 67 of the 90th Congress dedicated the United States to participate in the World Weather Program in order to develop improved worldwide weather observations and services and to conduct a comprehensive program of research to extend our understanding and prediction of global weather and climate variations. I am pleased to transmit, in accordance with that Resolution, this annual World Weather Plan that describes significant activities and accomplishments and outlines the planned participation of Federal agencies for the coming fiscal year. The progress already achieved in this vital program demonstrates that we truly can do something to help our people anticipate and cope with the effects of the world's weather.\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House,\n\nNovember 3, 1977.",
