Yours was a special participation and the overwhelming victory which your votes registered is a measure of the responsibility which goes with so overwhelming a popular mandate.\n\nWe shall assume that responsibility cheerfully and in full faith that democracy can be made to function in the world of today as effectively as it did in the simple world in which our Nation was born a century and a half ago.\n\nI trust that the dinner will be the rousing success which loyalty and fidelity to the principles merit.",
