    "date": "1962-10-29",
    "text": "ON OCTOBER 18th, I directed the Secretaries of Agriculture, Commerce and Interior to call the technical conference which begins today, and to invite the Governors and other State and local officials and Congressional delegations of the affected areas of California, Oregon and Washington, and representatives of the forest products industry. The conference will assess the damage, the rehabilitation measures necessary, and the economic impact of the rehabilitation measures.\n\nI have directed the Secretary of Commerce to maintain the closest surveillance over market conditions, and asked him to recommend any special programs deemed necessary to assure orderly marketing of the salvage timber taking into account the interests of producers in other parts of the United States, and the impact of imports. Canadian officials have been invited to participate as observers.\n\nI have also asked the Secretary of Agriculture to give particular attention to the problems of the smaller private owners of timber who suffered damage in the recent storm. Anything less than the best conservation course could have a dismaying impact upon a vital industry and the conference calls for the best effort of the Federal, State and local governments and the private owners. I send to you my best wishes.\n\nJOHN F. KENNEDY",
