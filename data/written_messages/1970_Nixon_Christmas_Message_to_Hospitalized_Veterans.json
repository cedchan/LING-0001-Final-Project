May you derive comfort and courage from your very special gift to the American people: your sacrifices in the cause of peace and freedom.\n\nIt is a gift that we can never fully return. But because of it, we are free to worship the Prince of Peace in this holy season; and we are nearer to the peace on earth we seek.\n\nOur thoughts will be with you--as will our prayers and our enduring thanks.",
