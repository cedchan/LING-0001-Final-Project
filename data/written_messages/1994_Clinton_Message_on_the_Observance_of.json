A time for rejoicing and celebrating, this Id in particular also reminds us of our shared responsibility to work for a better future for all the world's people\u2014especially in the wake of the Hebron massacre. Let us all rededicate ourselves to realizing this goal in the Middle East and around the world.\n\nIn the United States, this is an occasion for us to reflect with pride on the achievements of Muslim Americans and to take satisfaction in the historic and constructive relations which we have had with Muslim countries around the world. Central tenets of the Ramadan fast that is now ending are responsibility for those less fortunate and rededication\u2014individual by individual\u2014to the creation of a better community and a better world. These are ideals that stand as beacons for people of all faiths everywhere.\n\nOn this occasion, let me convey to you my very best wishes with the traditional greeting: May peace be with you and may God grant you health and prosperity now and in the years ahead.",
