The relationship between Italy and the United States has been warm and close for many years. President Kennedy added to this friendship. I intend to continue on this course and do all I can to ensure that the relationship will become even stronger and closer during your and my period of responsibility. We are partners in the North Atlantic Alliance, and our political, economic and military cooperation is of central importance to freedom.\n\nWe take office at almost the same time, and both of us will be very busy during these early days. I hope nevertheless that we will have an opportunity to meet before too long and to discuss the many matters of concern to our two countries.\n\nI wish you and your government every success in the tasks that lie ahead of you. Sincerely,\n\nLYNDON B. JOHNSON",
