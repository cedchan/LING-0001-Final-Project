    "text": "To the Senate and House of Representatives:\n\nI transmit herewith a communication of the Secretary of War, dated May 24, from which and from the accompanying papers it appears that the late General George W. Cullum, of the United States Army, has by will devised $250,000 to the Government of the United States for the erection of a memorial hall upon the grounds of the Military Academy at West Point, to be used as a \"receptacle of statues, busts, mural tablets, and portraits of distinguished deceased officers and graduates of the Military Academy, of paintings of battle scenes, trophies of war, and such other objects as may tend to give elevation to the military profession.\"\n\nThis ample and patriotic gift is hampered by no conditions and involves no appropriation beyond the sum so generously donated.\n\nThe executors in order to facilitate action have prepared, and the same is herewith submitted, the outline of a bill to carry into effect the Provisions of General Cullum's will.\n\nThere can be no occasion to urge upon Congress the immediate enactment of a suitable law to carry into effect the patriotic purpose expressed in the will.\n\nI suggest that in the bill itself, or by a separate joint resolution, suitable expression be given of the public appreciation of this crowning service to the military profession and to his country rendered by General Cullum.\n\nBENJ. HARRISON",
