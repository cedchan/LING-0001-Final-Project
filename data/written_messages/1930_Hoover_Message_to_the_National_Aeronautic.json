I will be obliged if you will express my cordial greetings and regrets to those present. These meetings and races are a definite contribution to the development of aviation, supplying stimulation, incentive demonstration and exchange of ideas that are invaluable. I hope the occasion will be a great success. Yours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
