    "text": "Dear Mr. President:\n\nEighteen years ago today Filipinos and Americans, in common struggle against tyranny, gave new vigor to man's quest for peace in freedom. It is fitting that we should pause each year to observe Bataan Day and to remind ourselves that liberty and justice are, indeed, worth whatever price we may be called upon to pay.\n\nEight years ago Filipinos and Americans were again fighting side-by-side to preserve the integrity of the Free World. I am confident that we will continue to work together to this end, and it is my profound hope that we will be able to safeguard our integrity without having thrust upon us again the necessity of taking up arms. The goals of our two peoples-the spiritual and material welfare of the individual, a free society dedicated to peace and justice--are deeply ingrained. The fact that they correspond to the aspirations of hundreds of millions of our fellow men should strengthen our determination to defend this heritage against any who would deny it to us.\n\nOn behalf of the American people, I wish to extend through you, Mr. President, my deep respect and affection for the Filipino people and their dedication to the democratic way of life. May we continue to draw common inspiration from the symbol of Bataan.\n\nWith high esteem, Sincerely,\n\nDWIGHT D. EISENHOWER",
