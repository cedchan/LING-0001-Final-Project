However, I have asked Charles F. Darlington, United States Ambassador to Gabon, to represent me at the ceremonies and festivities that you plan to hold September 27-29, 1962, in Usumbura. Ambassador Darlington is a distinguished American diplomat and a man eminently qualified to represent me and the people of the United States on such an important occasion.\n\nOnce again, I extend to the Government and people of the Kingdom of Burundi my sincere congratulations and those of the Government and people of the United States on the attainment of your independence. We look forward to close and friendly relations between our two countries. Sincerely,\n\nJOHN F. KENNEDY",
