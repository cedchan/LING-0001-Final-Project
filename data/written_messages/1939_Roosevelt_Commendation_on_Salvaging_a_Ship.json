The Commander-in-Chief expresses to all of you his appreciation of the untiring devotion to duty, courage, skill, initiative and self-sacrifice shown in the operations resulting in the rescue of the survivors and finally in the successful salvage of the U.S.S. Squalus. These hazardous and grueling tasks have been accomplished in spite of obstacles imposed by bad weather and unfavorable conditions incident to the great depth of water in which the Squalus was submerged.\n\n2. Your determined and efficient efforts have held the attention of the entire nation and the successful completion of this unprecedented task merits the highest approval and admiration.\n\n3. I commend you for upholding the reputation of the Navy in accordance with its time honored traditions.\n\n4. Well done!\n\n(S) FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT",
