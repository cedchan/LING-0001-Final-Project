Dated November 19, 1931\n\nI WAS ADVISED today of the special plan for statewide observance of Thanksgiving Day in Arkansas.\n\nThe remarkable recovery of Arkansas from the effects of the drought during 1930, which had followed floods in 1927, is evidence of the courage and energy of the people and of the blessings of Almighty Providence.\n\nReports show that Arkansas has been fortunate indeed. Weather conditions have been most favorable. Its harvest is the largest and most varied in years. Larders that were empty last year are now filled almost to overflowing. The people have enjoyed immunity from disease and pestilence.\n\nIt is not difficult for one to understand why its people, remembering that the first Thanksgiving centered about a harvest following a period of hardship and near famine, have come to realize its true significance.\n\nPlease will you convey my appreciation for this exemplification of the spirit of our people to the Chairman of the Statewide Committee having charge of the Thanksgiving observance as well as to the ministers, churches and other organizations.\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
