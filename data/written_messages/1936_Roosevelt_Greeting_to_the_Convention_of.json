The best thing about stamp collecting as a pursuit is that the enthusiasm which it arouses in youth increases as the years pass. It dispels boredom, enlarges our vision, broadens our knowledge of geography and in innumerable ways enriches life and adds to its joys.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nMr. Eugene Klein, American Philatelic Society, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.",
