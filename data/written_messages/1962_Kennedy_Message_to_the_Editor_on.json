    "text": "Dear Mr. Armstrong:\n\nOn the occasion of the 40th Anniversary of Foreign Affairs, it is a pleasure to send my heartiest congratulations to you and to all who shared in the creation of a great quarterly. By its \"broad hospitality to divergent ideas,\" its high standards of editorial integrity, and its responsible devotion to the best interests of the United States, Foreign Affairs has created an unrivaled forum for those who should be heard, and it has served our country well.\n\nLet me add that we all know in what extraordinary measure this achievement is the result of your own individual contribution. There are not many American institutions which owe so much to a single man, and I know that hundreds of your other contributors will join me in saluting a great American editor. Sincerely,\n\nJOHN F. KENNEDY [Mr. Hamilton Fish Armstrong, Editor, Foreign Affairs, 58 East 68th Street, New York 21, N.Y.]",
