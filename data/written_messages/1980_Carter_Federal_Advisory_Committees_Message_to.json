At the end of 1979: \u2014The total number of committees was 820; \u2014Although the number of committees required by statute increased (from 312 to 338), the number established under agency authority decreased (from 246 to 222); and \u2014Since the beginning of 1977 the total number of committees has been reduced by 339 (from 1,159).\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House, March 19, 1980.",
