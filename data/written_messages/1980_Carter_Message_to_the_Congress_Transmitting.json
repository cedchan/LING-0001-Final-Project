    "text": "To the Congress of the United States:\n\nI am pleased to transmit herewith the First Annual Report of the Office of Personnel Management for the Fiscal Year ended September 30, 1979, in accordance with the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-454, Sec. 906(a) (5 U.S.C. 1308(a)).\n\nThe report discusses the first year of operations under the comprehensive Civil Service Reform Act. The results are encouraging. The Senior Executive Service program has been overwhelmingly accepted by Federal managers and morale is high. The exchange of people, ideas and information between the Federal government and State and local governments has increased tremendously. The division of functions among the Office of Personnel Management, the Merit Systems Protection Board and the Federal Labor Relations Authority is working effectively.\n\nI am proud of the performance of thousands of dedicated civil servants, and of the leadership of the Office of Personnel Management and its Director, Alan Campbell. I encourage you to review this report, as we look ahead to the full implementation of the Act in the coming years.\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House, August 25, 1980.",
