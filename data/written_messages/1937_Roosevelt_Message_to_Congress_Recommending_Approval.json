    "text": "To the Congress:\n\nI transmit herewith a report of the Secretary of State enclosing a certified copy of the Interstate Compact to Conserve Oil and Gas, executed on May 10, 1937, by the Governors of the States of Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, New Mexico, and Colorado, which has been deposited in the Department of State of the United States in accordance with the provision contained therein. The compact refers to the Interstate Compact to Conserve Oil and Gas executed at Dallas, Texas, on February 16, 1935, which received the consent of the Congress in Public Resolution No. 64 Seventy-fourth Congress, approved August 27, 1935. As the above-mentioned compact will expire on September 1, 1937, the present compact provides that the original compact shall continue in force for two years from that date. In a letter from the Secretary of the Interior dated July 8, 1937, enclosed with the report of the Secretary of State, the opinion is expressed that some good may be accomplished by this compact.\n\nAccordingly, I hope that Congress will enact appropriate legislation giving its consent to this interstate compact as required by Article I, Section 10, of the Constitution of the United States.",
