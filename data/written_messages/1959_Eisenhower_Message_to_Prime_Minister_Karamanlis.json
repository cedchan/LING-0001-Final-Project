    "text": "Dear Mr. Prime Minister:\n\nI want you to know how very pleased I am by the recent developments concerning Cyprus and how deeply impressed I am by the spirit which you and Foreign Minister Averoff have demonstrated in making this possible.\n\nThe conclusion of an agreement on Cyprus is recognized throughout the world as a victory of common sense. I think that it is much more than that; it is also an imaginative and courageous act of statesmanship which cannot fail to strengthen and encourage the whole NATO alliance.\n\nI believe it is particularly significant that a final solution now promises to be reached within the framework of close Greek-Turkish cooperation. This cooperation offers tremendous advantages, not only to the two countries but indeed the entire Free World and particularly the Gypriot people themselves.\n\nI am very much aware of the difficulties which the problem has caused you and your Government. For this reason I am all the more appreciative of the perseverance and understanding which your Government has shown in reaching an agreement. With warm personal regard,\n\nDWIGHT D. EISENHOWER",
