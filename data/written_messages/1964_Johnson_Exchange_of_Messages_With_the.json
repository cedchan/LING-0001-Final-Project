We have been happy here to learn that he is expected to make a full recovery, and you can be assured that all Americans will understand that such an act has nothing to do with the deep friendship and understanding which exist between our two countries, and to which Ambassador Reischauer himself has made so important a contribution.\n\nLYNDON B.
