You may be assured that our efforts, along with our partners, to bring Namibia to independence via free and fair elections based on United Nations Security Council resolution 435 and to bring peace to the Southern Africa region will be unceasing. We will continue to cooperate with the OAU in your peacekeeping efforts in Chad. With every good wish, Sincerely,\n\nRONALD REAGAN",
