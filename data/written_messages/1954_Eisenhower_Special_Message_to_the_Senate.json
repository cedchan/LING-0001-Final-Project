It thus reaffirms our belief that the security of an individual nation in the free world depends upon the security of its partners, and constitutes another link in the collective security of the free nations of the Pacific.\n\nI recommend that the Senate give early favorable consideration to the treaty submitted herewith, and advise and consent to its ratification.\n\nDWIGHT D. EISENHOWER",
