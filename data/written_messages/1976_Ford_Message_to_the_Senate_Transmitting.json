    "text": "To the Senate of the United States:\n\nWith a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith a supplementary treaty on extradition between the United States and Spain, signed at Madrid on January 25, 1975.\n\nThe supplementary treaty modifies our treaty on extradition with Spain by increasing from 30 to 45 days the period of time during which a person may be provisionally arrested and detained pending presentation, through diplomatic channels, of documents in support of an extradition request. This change is in keeping with modern extradition treaties and is intended to prevent the release of an arrested person for lack of properly prepared extradition papers.\n\nI transmit also for the information of the Senate the report of the Department of State with respect to this supplementary treaty.\n\nI recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the supplementary treaty, and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n\nGERALD R. FORD The White House, February 3, 1976.",
