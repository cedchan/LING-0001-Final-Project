    "text": "To the Senate of the United States:\n\nI am returning herewith without my approval S. 1, the \"Keystone XL Pipeline Approval Act.\" Through this bill, the United States Congress attempts to circumvent longstanding and proven processes for determining whether or not building and operating a cross-border pipeline serves the national interest.\n\nThe Presidential power to veto legislation is one I take seriously. But I also take seriously my responsibility to the American people. And because this act of Congress conflicts with established executive branch procedures and cuts short thorough consideration of issues that could bear on our national interest\u2014including our security, safety, and environment\u2014it has earned my veto.\n\nBARACK OBAMA\n\nThe White House,\n\nFebruary 24, 2015.",
