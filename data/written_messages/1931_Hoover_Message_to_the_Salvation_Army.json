The Committee for Unemployment Relief under the Chairmanship of Mr. Horatio G. Lloyd has accomplished a great humanitarian task. The independent cooperation of the Salvation Army in this work has been invaluable. I am deeply interested in your efforts to finance the continuance of these labors through the private generosity of the people of Philadelphia, and I shall hope that you may meet with the most generous response. Yours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
