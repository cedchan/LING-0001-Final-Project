Your victory represents more than just another yachting triumph. It reflects the pinnacle of team work, competitiveness, hard work and American stick-to-it ingenuity. Your patience has paid off and all of America is proud. On a more personal note, having bet Prime Minister Hawke my favorite cowboy hat on your sailing abilities, I'm pleased to report that my head will remain warm and dry during my next visit to the ranch.\n\nI would be pleased to receive you and the crew at the White House upon your arrival in the United States. Sincerely,\n\nRONALD REAGAN",
