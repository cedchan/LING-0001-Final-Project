It is an equal pleasure to congratulate you on your inauguration as the first President of the Republic.\n\nI reaffirm American friendship and support for the aspirations of the people of Tanganyika and for the goals which your government has set as you begin this new and important chapter in your nation's history. Tanganyika's nonracial society is an outstanding example to all. The United States will continue to assist Tanganyika and other new nations in Africa in their drive for rapid social and economic advance. The progress of Tanganyika justifies our confidence and support.\n\nWith Tanganyika the United States shares African desires for the dignity and equality of the individual. We welcome new African nations to freedom and independence in the world community.\n\nI am confident that the friendly ties between Tanganyika and the United States will grow stronger in coming years. In partnership we can work for peace and progress.\n\nPlease accept my personal congratulations and good wishes for yourself and your country. Sincerely,\n\nJOHN F. KENNEDY",
