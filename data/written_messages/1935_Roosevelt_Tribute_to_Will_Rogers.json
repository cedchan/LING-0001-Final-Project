He loved and was loved by the American people.\n\nHis memory will ever be in benediction with the hosts of his countrymen who felt the spell of that kindly humor which while seeing facts could always laugh at fantasy. That was why his message went straight to the hearts of his fellow men. From him we can learn anew the homely lesson that the way to make progress is to build on what we have, to take from the lessons of yesterday a little more wisdom and courage to help us with the tasks of today.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nHonorable John N. Garner, Chairman, Will Rogers Memorial Commission, New York, N.Y.",
