I deeply regret that the pressure of imperative duties prevents my accepting your kind invitation to address the meeting. I wish especially to express appreciation for the generous and immeasurably helpful cooperation of the press of the nation in promoting an understanding of unemployment relief needs in their respective communities and supporting efforts to provide for all those in want.\n\nIt is natural that the economic dislocation through which we have been passing should elicit divergent views as to causes and remedies. Recovery and stability can return only through a return of confidence, and no agency can make so great a contribution to the restoration of confidence and a return of normal activity as the newspapers. I hope that your meeting will be productive of sound policies within your own profession and industry and that the publishers of the country will align themselves with the constructive forces which are promoting recovery. Yours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
