Although this year's celebration may not include the usual festivities and parades, the holiday's underlying story of perseverance and resilience is as relevant as ever. On this day 158 years ago, the Mexican army mounted a monumental defense of freedom, defeating imperialist French forces in the Battle of Puebla. The battle reminds us that great challenges and hardships can be overcome by unwavering resolve and a determined spirit.\n\n\nMelania joins me in recognizing the Mexican American community for its numerous exceptional contributions to our country, particularly today with so many Americans of Mexican descent serving on the frontlines in our fight against the coronavirus.\n\n\n\u00a1Feliz Cinco de Mayo!",
