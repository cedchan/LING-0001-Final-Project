I congratulate Chicago on the fact that one of its great institutions has made such an important contribution to the beauty of the city and by establishing the principle of air rights construction opened the way to a greater development of its business and commercial resources.\n\nI cordially extend my best wishes to the Chicago Daily News and its management. I hope that with the finer facilities of its new home and equipment, the Daily News will continue to be a leader of public enterprises and a moulder of sound public opinion valuable alike to its community and the nation.\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
