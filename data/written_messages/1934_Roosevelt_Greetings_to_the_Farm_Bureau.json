    "text": "My friends of the Farm Bureau:\n\nYou and I know that the year now ending has been one of significant accomplishment for agriculture. Despite the worst drought of record, farm income is running about a billion dollars above last year.\n\nAll of us would like to see an even larger increase in 1935, but we know that this cannot come unless, in the first place, industrial production increases sufficiently to expand the market for farm products; unless, in the second place, more of our export trade is paid for by increased imports; and unless, in the third place, agriculture continues to adjust its total production to the market that actually exists.\n\nTo fulfill these three requirements, I ask a continuation of the splendid support you have so unselfishly given in the past.\n\nI wish very much that it were possible for me to be with you today, and I give you my warm regards. American Farm Bureau Federation Nashville, Tenn.",
