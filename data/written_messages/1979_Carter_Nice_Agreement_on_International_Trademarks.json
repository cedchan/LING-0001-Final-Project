    "text": "To the Senate of the United States:\n\nWith a view to receiving the advice consent of the Senate to ratification, transmit herewith the revised Nice Agree. ment Concerning the International Classification of Goods and Services for Purposes of the Registration of done at Geneva on May 13, 1977. I transmit, for the information of the ate, the State Department report on Agreement.\n\nThe revised Agreement provides that amendments to the classification system may be made by a four-fifths majority of the members present and voting, instead of a unanimous vote, as the present ment requires. The other change is that the Agreement and classification are to be published in authentic English text, as well as French text.\n\nRatification of the revised A will enable the United States Patent Trademark Office to do its work more efficiently, and will improve the international system for the protection of trademarks. The revised Agreement would, thereby, benefit American trademark owners and the administration of the United States trademark system. I therefore recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the revised Agreement and advise and consent to its ratification.\n\nJIMMY CARTER The White House,\n\nJanuary 19, 1979.",
