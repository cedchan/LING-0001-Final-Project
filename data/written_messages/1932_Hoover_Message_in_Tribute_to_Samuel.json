It is a source of pride to all Americans that the vast system of instantaneous communications by means of the electrical telegraph originated in the mind of an American, Samuel F. B. Morse, whose culture was an honor to his country and whose character was an inspiration to mankind.\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
