    "text": "To the Heads of Executive Departments, Independent Establishments, and other Government agencies:\n\nIt is my desire that the heads of the executive departments and independent establishments of the Government will immediately cause a survey to be made of the expenditure requirements of their departments and establishments for the remaining months of the fiscal year 1937. It is apparent at this time that the revenues of the Government for the present fiscal year will be materially less than the amount estimated in my budget message of last January; and, hence, the deficit will be far greater than was anticipated unless there is an immediate curtailment of expenditures.\n\nYou will carefully examine the status of appropriations for your activities with a view to making a substantial saving by eliminating or deferring all expenditures which are not absolutely necessary at this time. You will report to me through the Acting Director of the Budget not later than May 1, 1937, the steps which you are undertaking to reduce expenditures and the amount of the estimated saving resulting therefrom.",
