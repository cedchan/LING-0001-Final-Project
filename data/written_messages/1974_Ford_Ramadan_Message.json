That strength has been greatly enhanced by your own religious heritage.\n\nI am sure that the completion of your month of fasting will bring home to you more than ever the importance of religious responsibilities in daily life. Fellow citizens of all faiths join you in this sentiment. We will be with you in spirit as you reaffirm your commitment to principles which exalt man's existence.\n\nMay your celebration and the special message of these holy days fortify and uplift each of you and add to our vitality as a nation.\n\nGERALD R. FORD",
