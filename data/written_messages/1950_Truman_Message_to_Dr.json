    "text": "The eleventh World's Christian Endeavor Convention meets at a time of world crisis but equally of world opportunity. Now as never before the moral and religious forces of the world must and will unite in defense of all the freedoms and to achieve an enduring peace.\n\nChristian Endeavor with its four million members in more than fifty countries is interracial, international, and interdenominational. It knows no lines of color, it preaches and practices the gospel of brotherhood and good will. Against atheistic communism it has a clear call to the world's youth.\n\nThe United States is pledging blood and treasure in support of the United Nations. Now in the defense of South Korea we join with other free nations not only to defend our own liberty but to help make the world secure against evil aggression.\n\nGod bless you and your associates in these fateful days.\n\nHARRY S. TRUMAN [Dr. Daniel A. Poling, President, World's Christian Endeavor Union, Russell Hotel, Russell Square, London, England]",
