He was not only the Ambassador of the United States to the United Nations, but a wise and unwavering friend of the United Nations within the councils of the United States. Knowing how deeply he cared for the United Nations, I find it a comfort to know from you as Secretary General how highly he was esteemed by his friends and colleagues there. We shall miss him, but from his life and work we can take courage for the future.\n\nLYNDON B. JOHNSON",
