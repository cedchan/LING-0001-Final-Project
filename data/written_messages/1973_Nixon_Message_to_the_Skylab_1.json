You have demonstrated that just as man can conquer the elements of Earth, he can cope with the exigencies of space. You have given conclusive evidence that, even with the most advanced scientific and technological support in the world, the courage and resourcefulness of good men are still central to the success of the human adventure.\n\nOn behalf of the American people, I welcome you home from the Skylab spaceship to spaceship Earth. I also look forward to seeing you at San Clemente on Sunday.\n\nRICHARD NIXON",
