There is clearly a tremendous field still for organized efforts to promote accident prevention, especially in the home and on the highways, and to a considerable extent in industry, in spite of a decrease of one-third in industrial accidents in the past two decades. The fact that there are 33,000 motor vehicle deaths annually in the United States is a challenge to the efforts of safety organizations and the cooperation of every motor-vehicle operator. The National Safety Council renders a conspicuously important service in promoting safety measures. Please present to its members gathered for the annual Safety Congress in Chicago my congratulations on their achievements. I trust that the meeting may be conducive to still greater effort to safeguard human life and property. Yours faithfully,\n\nHERBERT HOOVER",
