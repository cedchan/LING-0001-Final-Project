    "text": "The President. Thank you very much. Thanks.\n\nAs you could tell, I didn't want to leave the clinic. Those children were wonderful.\n\nThank you, Arseme\u2014Arsema, and\u2014for that introduction. And Jill and I were honored to visit your clinic today. We met with your fellow nurses and staff who are stepping up each and every day. And we met with families of young children. And there were about, I guess, 17, 18 families there waiting for their vaccine shots or have just gotten their vaccine shots and, finally, COVID-19 vaccinations for children over 5 years of age. Finally, some peace of mind. You know, this is\u2014or, shall I say, under 5 years. We have them for over 5 years. But over 5 months to\u20146 months to 5 years.\n\nAnd a historic\u2014this is a very historic milestone, a monumental step forward. The United States is now the first country in the world to offer safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines for children as young as 6 months old. In the first time in our fight against this pandemic, nearly every American can now have access to lifesaving vaccines.\n\nAnd we're ready. My administration, with the help of the CDC, has been planning and preparing this moment\u2014for this moment for a long time. Since I took office, we've been committed to making sure every parent has the opportunity to protect their children from COVID-19. We've secured enough doses, and we're launching a comprehensive effort with States, local health departments, pediatricians, family doctors, pharmacies, rural health clinics, community health centers, and other trusted messengers and partners to get the word out to get\u2014help to get shots in arms.\n\nParents will soon be able to start scheduling an appointment and addressing vaccines at pediatricians' offices, children's hospitals. Our largest pharmacies\u2014partners and\u2014that are Walgreens, CVS, and Walmart\u2014are already scheduling appointments for later this week.\n\nAnd starting today, you can go to vaccines.gov and find information and appointments near you. More and more locations will be ramping up, and more vaccines are delivered to providers in your areas every day.\n\nThese vaccines are safe and effective and are approved after extensive scientific review by the Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC. But I know some parents might have questions. I encourage you to talk to the doctor\u2014after you make a plan to get your child vaccinated\u2014for your children older than 5 years of age.\n\nFor everyone else: Get your shots. Get your boosters.\n\nAnd let's be clear: Elected officials shouldn't get in the way and make it more difficult for parents who want their children to be vaccinated, who want to protect them and those around them. This is no time for politics. It's about parents being able to do everything they can to keep their children safe.\n\nTogether, we've come to\u2014a long way in our fight against COVID with vaccines, treatments, and other tools that are widely available. More than 220 million Americans are fully vaccinated. More than 100 million Americans are boosted. Daily deaths due to COVID-19 are down 90 percent. And now vaccinations are available for nearly every American.\n\nAnd we'll remain vigilant. We will make sure that this is not only a good day, but it's good from this point on, proof that there is nothing beyond our capacity when we work together as the United States of America.\n\nI want to thank you again, Arsema. And may God bless you, our health care workers across the country and continue\u2014who continue to step up and help put this pandemic behind us.\n\nAnd, Doc, did you want to say anything? You don't have to.\n\nWhite House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Ashish K. Jha. I'm happy to, sir.\n\nThe President. All right. Okay.\n\nCoordinator Jha. Or just\u2014whatever you like.\n\nThe President. All right. \n\nOil Industry/Renewable Energy \n\nQ. Mr. President\u2014\u2014\n\nThe President. Yes.\n\nQ. Quick question on the Chevron CEO's complaint today. He said that your administration has largely criticized the oil and gas industry and at times vilified it, and that the administration would need to take a change in approach in order to make progress on reducing energy prices and to increase supply. Do you have a reaction to that, sir?\n\nThe President. He's mildly sensitive. I didn't know they'd get their feelings hurt that quickly.\n\nLook, we need more refining capacity. This idea that they don't have oil to drill and to bring up is simply not true. This piece of\u2014the Republicans talking about, \"Biden shut down fields\"\u2014wrong. There are 9,000 of them, okay?\n\nSo they\u2014we ought to be able to work something out whereby they're able to increase refining capacity and still not give up on transitioning to renewable energy. They're both within the realm of possibility.\n\nInfrastructure Legislation/Federal Gas Tax \n\nQ. Mr. President, if you were to decide to go for a Federal gas tax holiday, do you believe Congress would support that? And how would you feel about the fact that those funds are used for something that is a big priority for you, repair of roads and infrastructure and all of that? Is that work the\u2014\u2014\n\nThe President. We have a giant infrastructure bill we passed\u2014giant\u20141.2\u20141 trillion, 200 billion dollars.\n\nQ. So you'd be worth\u2014it would be worth it for you to\u2014\u2014\n\nThe President. Sure. It's not like\u2014you know, it's not like before. Look, it will have some impact, but it's not going to be impact on major road construction and major repairs.\n\nQ. Sounds like you may have made a decision?\n\nThe President. Well, let me put this way: I'm in the process. I'll have a decision before the week is out. But you asked me an explicit question about whether or not\u2014how would I feel; is it going to, in fact, make it difficult to maintain our roads. The answer is, we have plenty of capacity to do that.\n\nQ. And do you think that you have their support?\n\nPresident Xi Jinping of China \n\nQ. Mr. President, are you going to talk to President Xi before you make any decision on the China tariffs? Do you want to have an engagement with him before you do things\u2014anything on that?\n\nThe President. I plan on having a conversation with President Xi. We haven't set a time yet.\n\nThe President's Scheduled Travel to Israel \n\nQ. Mr. President, any changes on your planned trip to Israel, given what's happened with the Parliament?\n\nThe President. No.\n\nQ . Mr. President\u2014\u2014\n\nQ . Have you been briefed, sir\u2014\u2014\n\nInflation \n\nQ. Thank you. I think you spoke with Larry Summers recently. And he just said that in order to defeat inflation, we will have to accept higher unemployment. What would be your answer to that?\n\nThe President. Well, there's other economists who don't think that's the case. And we're in the process of working through all of this.\n\nGun Control Legislation \n\nQ. And have you received a briefing on the guns legislation? The Senators say that they've gotten to a legislative text point.\n\nThe President. Very brief\u2014briefly before I walked into the room to make sure I say: Let them announce it, and then I'll speak to it.\n\nQ. Are you satisfied?\n\nThe President. Let them announce; then I'll speak to it.\n\nCOVID-19 Vaccination Efforts \n\nQ. Mr. President, are you accounting\u2014have\u2014I know you're looking for more money from Congress for this vaccine campaign and for COVID funding going into the fall. How much of the supply of vaccines for these small children is there? And how many of the Nation's kids will you be able to get vaccinated before you need more money from Congress?\n\nThe President. Well, we'll get through at least this year. We do need more money. But we don't just need more money for vaccines for children, eventually; we need more money to plan for the second pandemic. There's going to be another pandemic. We have to think ahead. And that's not something the last outfit did very well. That's something we've been doing for\u2014fairly well. That's why we need the money.\n\nThank you all very much.\n\nQ. Mr. President\u2014\u2014\n\nUkraine/Russia/North Atlantic Treaty Organization Summit in Madrid, Spain\n\nQ. Ahead of your trip, sir: Prime Minister Boris Johnson said recently there is \"Ukraine fatigue.\" There are some leaders who are calling for negotiations with Putin. Are you afraid that there is a fracture within this alliance that you've said has been united so far?\n\nThe President. No, I'm not afraid. But what I do think is, there\u2014at some point, this is going to be a bit of a waiting game: what the Russians can sustain and what Europe is going to be prepared to sustain.\n\nAnd I think we have to\u2014that's one of the things we're going to be speaking at\u2014in Spain about.\n\nThank you all so very, very much.\n\nQ. Thank you, sir.\n\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President.",
