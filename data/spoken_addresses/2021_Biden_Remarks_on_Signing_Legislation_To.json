I'm Jill's husband. \n\nCollapse of the Champlain Towers South Condominium Building in Surfside, Florida \n\nBefore I sign, let me start with a few words about what's going on now in Florida. And you know, the people who are here, who were part of what happened that night at the Pulse nightclub and the scores that I just spoke to a moment ago\u2014they're online looking at this\u2014they understand that\u2014what it's like to have to wait and wonder what happened.\n\nThe families\u2014I remember going down there to the Pulse nightclub afterwards\u2014and wondering: \"Is it my son, my daughter, my husband, someone I love\u2014is that who got lost?\" Because you didn't know for certain initially.\n\nAnd as Congressman Cicilline knows, there's nothing worse than having to wait and wonder what happened. And I know, Val, when you were a police chief, you had to go through waiting a lot as well.\n\nAnd so I just want to say, I've spoken to Governor DeSantis. And we've provided all the help that they have\u2014they need. We sent the best people from FEMA down there. We're going to stay with them; with the disaster declaration we made, provide for everything from housing to, God forbid, whether there's a need for moratoria\u2014if there are\u2014to\u2014for the bodies to be placed. Everything in between.\n\nAnd\u2014but I just want to say\u2014and I'm sure I speak for all the Members of the Congress here today and all the survivors here that it's a tough, tough time. There's so many people waiting. \"Are they alive? Will they be\u2014what will happen?\" And so our heart goes out to them.\n\nAnd I\u2014to the people of Florida, I want to\u2014I've spoken to Debbie Wasserman Schultz. I've spoken to most of the folks down there and member\u2014in authority. And I promise you, the administration, the Congress, we're doing everything possible to be of assistance now and after this occurs\u2014after they decide exactly what the state of play is.\n\nLegislation To Designate the National Pulse Memorial \n\nBut I'm glad to welcome everyone here to the adjunct to the White House here, and in person and virtually: survivors and family members, victims, and the path-breaking leaders like Senator Baldwin.\n\nJust over 5 years ago, the Pulse nightclub, a place of acceptance and joy, became a place of unspeakable pain and loss. And we'll never fully recovery, but we'll remember. And we have to\u2014what we're going to do is what the Members of Congress here did and enshrine in law\u2014as a consequence of that law, enshrine, in perpetuity, literally a monument to the loss that occurred there, and an absolute determination that we're going to deal with this every single, solitary day and make sure that we're not in a position to see this happen again.\n\nBehind me, you see, on either board there, the 49 lives lost: family members, parents, friends, veterans, students, young, Black, Asian, Latino\u2014all fellow Americans. And in their memory and for the countless others forever scarred is why I sign this today.\n\nAnd let me say how much I appreciate it\u2014and I mean this sincerely\u2014the commitment of the Members of the House and Senate to make sure that we don't forget\u2014that this isn't forgotten.\n\nNow, there's a tradition when a bill is signed that the President gives a signing pen to each of the people who had something to do with the law or the decision being made in the first place.\n\nI promise you, I have all the pens, but they're in the other room. I couldn't figure how to sign\u2014 \u2014sign them all. But don't leave without the pen. Okay? All right? All right.\n\nRepresentative Mark A. Takano. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nRepresentative Darren M. Soto. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n \n\nThe President. May we never have to sign another\u2014no President ever have to sign another monument like this. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\n\nAnd one last thing, as I said to\u2014to the survivors and their\u2014those who lost folks, a little earlier, in private: You know, what the Congress has done means a great deal, and it's important. But it's really hard; it brings back everything as if it happened yesterday.\n\nAnd every time there's a memorial service for our son Beau, you know, you're flattered. You feel good about it. You think it's wonderful\u2014the recognition. But it's tough. It's as if it happened yesterday, it happened the day before, it happened the moment you're signing it.\n\nSo I want to thank the folks who are here and the folks who are survivors who are on Zoom with us. I want to thank them for their courage\u2014I really mean it\u2014for their courage.\n\nBut, I promise you, none of the Members of Congress that are here, nor I, nor Jill are going to let up until we deal with equity across the board.\n\nThank you so very much.\n\nEquality Florida Action Inc. Central Florida Development Officer and Media Relations Manager Brandon Wolf. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nThe President. And you've got to come back and get your pens. ",
