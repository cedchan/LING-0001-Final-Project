    "text": "The President. Well, look, the reason I'm here today is\u2014all of these technology manufacturing leaders around the country and all over the world on the screen\u2014is to talk about how we strengthen our domestic semiconductor industry and secure America's supply chain.\n\nThis is an issue that has broad support in United States Congress. We've talked about whether or not we're doing anything in terms of bipartisanly. Well, we are. Both sides of the aisle are strongly supportive of what we're proposing, and I\u2014and where I think we can really get things done for the American people.\n\nIn fact, today I received a letter from 23 Senators\u2014bipartisanly\u2014and 42 House Members\u2014Republican and Democrats\u2014supporting the CHIPS for America program. Now, let me quote from the letter. It says, \"the Chinese Communist Party has\u2014aggressively plans to reorient and dominate the semiconductor supply chain . . .\" And it goes into how much money they're pouring in to being able to be able to do that. But I've just\u2014I've been saying for some time now: China and the rest of the world is not waiting, and there's no reason why Americans should wait.\n\nWe're investing aggressively in areas like semiconductors and batteries. That's what they're doing and others; so must we. We are seeking a significant investment in the\u2014in this piece of legislation. And it's important, but we know it's not sufficient.\n\nThe American Jobs Plan that I've put forward is part of\u2014about revitalizing American manufacturing and securing our supply chains, investing in research and development, as we used to, in a very healthy manner.\n\nBut it's also about much more than that. It's about investing in infrastructure and infrastructure not for the 20th century, but the 21st century. It's not just roads and bridges. We're investing in water systems so Americans can have clean water infrastructure. We're investing in high-speed rail infrastructure. We're building charging stations to support America's electric future\u2014electric vehicle future and investing in that infrastructure; and building out America's supply chains so we never again are at the mercy of another country or any other nation for the critical needs. That's what we would mean by investing in infrastructure.\n\nAnd we're investing in a more resilient grid, investing\u2014I understand you discussed that a little bit earlier today. Investing as well in asbestos-free schools for our kids, that's investing in infrastructure. Building a support system to take care of our elderly parents and our kids with disabilities at home so that people can go to work, that's investing in infrastructure.\n\nChips, like the one I have here\u2014\u2014\n\n \n\n\u2014\u2014these chips, these wafers, or batteries, broadband, it's all infrastructure. This is infrastructure.\n\nSo, look, we need to build the infrastructure of today, not repair the one of yesterday. And the plan I propose is going to create millions of jobs, rebuild America, protect our supply chains, and revitalize American manufacturing. And it's going to make American research and development a great engine again. We led the world in the middle of the 20th century. We led the world toward the end of the century. We're going to lead the world again. We're going to lead it again in the 21st century. We're\u2014we have the best minds in the country; many of them are on the screen right now. And they know better than anyone that our competitiveness depends on where you invest and how you invest.\n\nFor too long as a nation, we haven't been making the big, bold investments we need to outpace our global competitors. We've been falling behind on research and development and manufacturing. And put it bluntly, we have to step up our game.\n\nAnd I'm not ready to give up. I'm ready to work with all of you, with the Congress\u2014both parties\u2014to pass the American Jobs Plan and to make a once-in-a-generation investment in America's future.\n\nAgain, we'll provide the innovation and spur breakthroughs. And we need the support\u2014all your support\u2014on the screen and others, in order to get this work done. And we need you, in turn, to support the American workers and American communities in every part of the country.\n\nThis is a moment for American strength and American unity; for government, industries, communities to work together to make sure that we're ready to meet the global competition that lies ahead, not continuing to slide in terms of our investment. We're ranked, like, number 25th in the world now. That's not American.\n\nSo I want to thank you all very much. And I appreciate all the time you've given us.\n\nQ. Mr. President\u2014\u2014 \n\nPolice-Involved Shooting of Daunte Wright in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, on April 11 \n\nQ. Mr. President, could you speak to the issue in Minnesota, please, sir?\n\nQ . Mr. President, do you have a reaction to the shooting of Daunte Wright?\n\nQ. Wait. The President is going to speak.\n\nThe President. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on, just a second.\n\nQ. Mr. President, would you like to speak to the issue in Minnesota?\n\nThe President. Wait, wait. Wait a\u2014well, wait a second. What I'm going to do\u2014I'm going to see you all again in a few minutes. I have just took\u2014taken the time, even though I was a few minutes late, to listen to the press conference. I'm preparing a statement, and I'll be happy to talk with you at the next meeting.\n\nOkay? Thank you so much.\n\nQ . Thank you, sir.",
