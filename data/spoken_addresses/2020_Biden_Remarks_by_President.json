    "text": " \n\nGood afternoon, everyone.\n\n\nThis morning the United States Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a case of grave importance to all Americans.\n\n\nThis case represents the latest attempt by far-right ideologues to do what they have repeatedly failed to do \u2014 in the courts, in Congress, and in the court of public opinion over the last decade: eliminate the entire Affordable Care Act.\n\n\nTwice already, the Supreme Court has upheld this landmark law \u2014 in 2012 and 2015.\n\n\nAnd the Congress, expressing the popular will of the American people and on a bipartisan basis, has rejected the numerous efforts of President Trump to erase the law as well.\n\n\nNow, in the midst of a deadly pandemic that has infected more than 10 million Americans \u2014 nearly one out of every 32 of our people \u2014 often with devastating consequences to their health; these ideologues are once again trying to strip health coverage away.\n\n\nThe goal of the outgoing Administration is clear from the brief they filed with the Court.\n\n\nIt asserts, quote: \"The entire ACA thus must fall.\"\n\n\nNow, I'm not naive about the fact that health care is an issue that has divided Americans in the past.\n\n\nBut the truth is, the American people are more united on this issue today than they are divided.\n\n\nAs recently as last month, a leading survey found that Americans want to keep the Affordable Care Act in place by an overwhelming margin of 22 percent.\n\n\nSeventy-nine percent of Americans \u2014 including nine out of ten Democrats, eight out of ten Independents, and two-thirds of Republicans \u2014 want to keep the ACA's protections for people with pre-existing conditions, which would be eliminated if this lawsuit were to succeed.\n\n\nThis doesn't need to be a partisan issue.\n\n\nThis is a human issue. It affects every single American family.\n\n\nAnd we can't subvert the growing consensus of the American people based on arguments put forward in the briefs seeking to invalidate the law that even many conservative legal scholars, including in the National Review, consider to be ridiculous.\n\n\nLet's be absolutely clear about what's at stake here.\n\n\nThe consequences of the Trump Administration's argument are not academic or an abstraction.\n\n\nFor many Americans, they are a matter of life and death.\n\n\nThis argument will determine whether the health coverage of more than 20 million Americans will be ripped away in the middle of the worst public health crisis in a century.\n\n\nWhether 100 million people with pre-existing conditions like asthma, diabetes, and cancer could once again be denied coverage.\n\n\nWhether complications from COVID-19, like lung scarring and heart damage, will become the next flood of pre-existing conditions that could be used as an excuse to jack up premiums or deny coverage altogether for millions of survivors who have struggled and won the fight of their lives against coronavirus.\n\n\nThis argument will determine whether women can once again be charged higher premiums just because they are women.\n\n\nWhether seniors will see their prescription drug prices go up.\n\n\nWhether kids will still be able to stay on their parents' plans up to age 26.\n\n\nAnd whether annual and lifetime limits on your benefits will be re-imposed.\n\n\nThis isn't hyperbole \u2014 this is real. As real as it gets.\n\n\nWhen a family is faced with that awful news of a child diagnosed with leukemia, a mom forced to battle against breast cancer, an accident that leaves a loved one unable to live the life they've always known \u2014 it stops your heart.\n\n\nIt wrenches your entire world off of its axis.\n\n\nBelieve me \u2014 I know that feeling. Too many American families do.\n\n\nAnd in that moment, the very last thing on your mind \u2014 the very last thing that should be on your mind \u2014 is whether you can afford treatment.\n\n\nThe Affordable Care Act was created to put a stop to that inhumanity.\n\n\nIt was created to ensure that families thrust into the worst nightmare of their lives could focus not on money, but on the fight that really matters.\n\n\nObamacare is a law that every American should be proud of.\n\n\nIt's why people with pre-existing conditions are protected in this country.\n\n\nIt's a law that delivered vital coverage to more than 20 million Americans.\n\n\nIt's a law that reduced prescription drug costs for nearly 12 million seniors.\n\n\nIt's a law that has saved lives and spared countless families from financial ruin.\n\n\nSo this effort to bypass the will of the people, the verdict of the courts, and the judgment of Congress is simply cruel and needlessly divisive.\n\n\nBut regardless of the outcome of this case, I promise you this:\n\n\nBeginning on January 20th, Vice President-elect Harris and I are going to do everything in our power to ease the burden of health care on you and your families.\n\n\nThat starts by building on the Affordable Care Act with a dramatic expansion of health coverage and bold steps to lower health care costs.\n\n\nMy transition team will soon be starting its work to flesh out the details so that we can hit the ground running tackling costs, increasing access, and lowering the price of prescription drugs.\n\n\nFamilies are reeling right now, enduring illnesses; forced into risky choices; losing their employer plans in droves.\n\n\nThey need a lifeline now.\n\n\nThey shouldn't have to hold their breath, waiting to see if the Supreme Court is going to wrench away the peace of mind they've come to rely on.\n\n\nSo we are going to get right to work, addressing the issues that families are talking about around their kitchen tables.\n\n\nMaking sure that they can go to bed at night with the peace of mind they deserve.\n\n\nAnd fulfilling our moral obligation to ensure that, here in America, health care is a right for all, not a privilege for the few.\n\n\nSo, come January, we will work quickly with Congress to dramatically ramp up health care protections, get America to universal coverage, and lower health care costs as soon as humanly possible.\n\n\nThat is our promise to you: we will fight for your family's health coverage the same way we would fight for our own.\n\n\nAnd we want every single American to know, if you're sick; if you're struggling; if you're worried about how you're going to get through the day \u2014\n\n\nWe will not abandon you.\n\n\nWe will not leave you to face these challenges alone.\n\n\nWe are going to get through this together.\n\n\nAnd we are going to build a health care system that puts you and your family first and that every American can be proud of.\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\nGod bless you and may God protect our troops.",
