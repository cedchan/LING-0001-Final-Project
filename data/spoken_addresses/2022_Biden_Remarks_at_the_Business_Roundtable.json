    "text": "Thank you. My name is Joe Biden, and I come from Delaware, which has more corporations incorporated than all of the rest of the country combined. \n\nAnd I know of the Business Roundtable because in the days when I first\u2014\u2014\n\n \n\n\u2014\u2014ran for office\u2014excuse me\u2014in 1972, for the United States Senate, the DuPont company was the eighth largest corporation in America. As they say in Delaware, those were the good old days. But all kidding aside, thank you for having me. You're a hell of an organization. I appreciate it.\n\nAnd I want to thank you, Josh. We've known each other a long, long time. And you know, I've hosted CEO roundtables, you know, in the White House, including with many of you over the years. And we've worked together on the American Rescue Plan, on COVID, on infrastructure, supply chains, innovation, on climate and clean energy, reducing costs and a whole lot more.\n\nAnd our strategy has worked, I believe, and I think it's still working. 6.7 million jobs last year\u2014the most ever created in 1 year; more than 7 million now. 678,000 created just last month, in 1 month. Unemployment down to 3.8 percent. Our economy grew at 5.7 percent last year and the strongest in nearly 40 years.\n\nAnd we reduced the deficit, we reduced the deficit\u2014I want to say it again: We reduced the deficit by $360 billion last year, notwithstanding all that I hear on some channels when I turn them on. And we're on track to reduce it by over $1 trillion this year.\n\nAnd that groundwork has positioned our economy to deal with the global problem of inflation, which is real; a lot of people are being hurt by it.\n\nAnd it's underscored that America is a great place to invest. Intel is investing $20 million\u2014billion in a semiconductor campus in Ohio. I think\u2014Mary, I think GM is investing about $7 billion in a new plant and equipment. And, Ford, I think you're doing $11 billion.\n\nThe point is, these are history-making investments to build electric vehicles here at home. We've seen record electric vehicle sales, along with records in solar, wind, and battery storage as well. In the\u2014sector after sector, we're making it in America again. And that's what my overwhelming objective is: to make it in America.\n\nWith the infrastructure law, we're going to keep building millions of good-paying jobs, and they're real jobs. And to build on progress, the Senate and House need to work on the innovation bill and send it to my desk. It's important for our economy and, I would argue, for our national security as well.\n\nAnd we're also leading on the global stage because of you all. I'm pleased to see American companies stepping up and doing their part. And what you're doing in terms of donating to Ukraine and winding down your operations without anybody requesting it. I want to make that clear: You're on your own on winding down operations in Russia. Not all, but many have. Not only you, but around the world.\n\nAnd for the first time\u2014on that subject, let me say this\u2014for the first time that Putin began amassing troops along the Ukrainian border, I called for an emergency meeting of NATO in Europe to make the case that we had to be united.\n\nThe one thing I'm confident, knowing Putin fairly well\u2014as well as, I guess, another leader could know one another\u2014is that he was counting on being able to split NATO. He never thought NATO would stay resolved\u2014stay totally, thoroughly united. And I can assure you: NATO has never been stronger or more united in its entire history than it is today, in large part because of Vladimir Putin.\n\nAnd\u2014but you know, in response to his aggression, there has been\u2014we presented a united front throughout NATO and in the Pacific. The Quad is\u2014with the possible exception of India being somewhat shaky on some of this. But Japan has been extremely strong, so has Australia, in terms of dealing with Putin's aggression. We presented a united front throughout NATO and the Pacific.\n\nAnd you did a hell of a lot to help us impose sanctions and incur costs\u2014real costs\u2014on the Russian economy. And we're seeing now that it mattered. It was really important what you all did. Not every one of you, but\u2014I'm not suggesting you all had to\u2014but those of you who did step up, it made a big\u2014made a big difference. And I'm personally, as President, grateful for that.\n\nBut because of our response\u2014because our response is working, because the Ukrainians are fighting so valiantly and using the equipment we've given them\u2014and the United States alone has committed over $2 billion to NATO. The idea that they don't have enough sophisticated equipment is just simply not accurate. And I'm not going to take the time to go into all of the detail here, but the point is, they have every equipment\u2014every piece of equipment that makes rational sense, based on our military and NATO's military, for them to be able to do what they're doing. And they're wreaking havoc on the Russian military, whether it's their tanks or their helicopters or their aircraft.\n\nAnd, if you notice, they've just launched a\u2014their hypersonic missile, because it's the only thing that they can get through with absolute certainty. It's\u2014as you all know, it's a consequential weapon. And\u2014but\u2014with the same warhead on it as a\u2014as any other launched missile. It doesn't make that much difference, except it's almost impossible to stop it. There's a reason they're using it.\n\nAnd now Putin's back is against the wall. He wasn't anticipating the extent or the strength of our unity. And the more his back is against the wall, the greater the severity of the tactics he may employ. We've seen it before. He's run a lot of false-flag operations. Whenever he starts talking about something he thinks NATO, Ukraine, or the United States is about to do, it means he's getting ready to do it. Not a joke.\n\nYou may recall\u2014I said this to a few of you this morning that I was able to declassify a whole range of operations that they were about to engage in without sacrificing sources and methods. And it was able to give everybody clear notice what was about to come. And it convinced a lot of our friends around the world that we know what they're about to do.\n\nAnd so his back is against the wall. And he's\u2014now he's talking about new false flags he's setting up, including he's asserting that, we, in America, have biological as well as chemical weapons in Europe\u2014simply not true. I guarantee you.\n\nThey're also suggesting that Ukraine has biological and chemical weapons in Ukraine. That's a clear sign he is considering using both of those. He's already used chemical weapons in the past, and we should be careful of what about\u2014of what's about to come. He knows there will be severe consequences because of the united NATO front, but the point is, it's real.\n\nAnd what I want to mention very much\u2014very quickly with you all is, one of the tools he's most likely to use, in my view, in our view, is cyber\u2014cyber attacks. They have a very sophisticated cyber capability.\n\nI've had, as they say in southern Delaware, where they\u2014where they are very religious: We've had an \"altar call,\" he and I, on this issue. We've had a long conversation about, if he uses it, what would be the consequence.\n\nBut the point is that he has a capability; he hasn't used it yet. And\u2014but it's part of his playbook. And I've warned about the potential for Russian conduct to maliciously\u2014malicious cyber activity in response to the cost we'd impose, with our allies and partners, on the world.\n\nBut look, today my administration has issued renewed warnings that, based on evolving intelligence, Russia may be planning a cyber attack against us. And as I've said, the magnitude of Russia's cyber capacity is fairly consequential, and it's coming. The Federal Government is doing its part to get ready. But under U.S. law, as you all remember, the private sector, all of you, largely decides the protections that as\u2014we will or will not take in order to protect your sources.\n\nBut let me be absolutely clear about something: It's not just in your interests that are at stake with their potential use of cybersecurity, it is in\u2014the national interest is at stake.\n\nAnd I would respectfully suggest it's a patriotic obligation for you to invest as much as you can in making sure\u2014and we will urge\u2014we'll help in any way that you have built up your technological capacity to deal with cyber capacity\u2014with cyber attacks: first, to protect your own companies; second, that provides critical\u2014as providers of critical services that Americans rely on, from power to clean water; and finally, your role you can play in helping secure every American and every American's privacy.\n\nFor example, banks can turn on cybersecurity to\u2014by default for every customer so America's financial data is safe. And we're prepared to help you, as I said, with any tools and expertise we possess if you're ready to do that. But it's your decision as to the steps you'll take and your responsibility to take them, not ours.\n\nNow we need to do what's necessary to support Ukraine, but we also need to step up for the families here at home.\n\nIn 2019, your organizations realized\u2014excuse me\u2014released a statement with a signature of almost everyone in this room. And it says, quote, \"America deserves an economy that allows each person to succeed through hard work and creativity and to lead a life of meaning and dignity.\" And it expressed a commitment from you to invest in your workforce and support local communities. It wasn't a do-gooder statement, it was a capitalist statement. We're all capitalists in this room. And you did the right thing, in my view, in the assertion of that statement.\n\nThis was your view about how to run strong, profitable companies over the long term. And this commitment of consequence and peril\u2014for\u2014peril for the free world is vital that you reaffirm that commitment, in my humble opinion.\n\nWe can't afford to prioritize shareholders at the expense of your stakeholders, the environment, your workers, your customers, your communities where they live and work. And you're not doing that, but I think the inclination\u2014would be inclined to do that on some occasions.\n\nInstead, now's the time to invest in your people. You can hire and retain the best workforce\u2014best trained workforce in the entire world, which you've been doing.\n\nTo invest in innovation so you can\u2014we can deliver better and more affordable products and services from\u2014to more Americans. To innovate with and for diversity, as you said in your statement, as you committed to earlier this year.\n\nCultivating tools of artificial intelligence and advanced * dignity and opportunity for all Americans is what you've been doing, many of you, and it really matters. And to invest in America itself in manufacturing; created over 450,000 manufacturing jobs because of you all, and it really matters. It hadn't happened in a long time.\n\nAs one of my colleagues from the Midwest said: We're not going to talk about the Rust Belt anymore; we're going to talk about new, expanded manufacturing capacity in the Middle\u2014in the Middle Atlantics\u2014excuse me, in the Midwest. And to invest in America itself\u2014in manufacturing, climate resilience, clean energy\u2014so America can win the competition of the 21st century.\n\nAnd it won't hurt your bottom lines or the economy. It helps continue us\u2014it will help us grow while lowering costs and lowering the deficit.\n\nSo I want to thank you again for\u2014there's much more to say, but I've already probably taken too much time\u2014of your time right now. But I'm happy\u2014I'm told I'm\u2014we're going to take some questions, Mary. Is that right? Well, I'm happy to start taking questions. But thank you for all you've been doing.\n\nI think\u2014you know, my mother had an expression: \"Out of everything terrible, something good will come if you look hard enough for it.\" I think this presents us with some significant opportunities to make some real changes. You know, we are at an inflection point, I believe, in the world economy\u2014not just the world economy, in the world. It occurs every three or four generations.\n\nAs one of the top military people said to me in a secure meeting the other day, 60 million people died between 1900 and 1946. And since then, we've established a liberal world order, and that hasn't happened in a long while. A lot of people dying, but nowhere near the chaos.\n\nAnd now is a time when things are shifting. We're going to\u2014there's going to be a new world order out there, and we've got to lead it. And we've got to unite the rest of the free world in doing it.\n\nSo, anyway, I'm going to hush up. Mary, fire away.\n\n ",
