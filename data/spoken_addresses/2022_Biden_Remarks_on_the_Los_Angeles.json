    "text": "Well, hello, everyone. My problem is, I'm getting to like these people too much. We're going to get one another in trouble, I'm afraid.\n\nToday the leaders on this stage are joining together to make what\u2014and is almost\u2014it's an overused phrase in international relations and public life: to make a historic commitment. Because it is a historic commitment we're about to make: 20 countries coming together to launch the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection.\n\nWith this declaration, we're transforming our approach to managing migration in the Americas. Each of us\u2014each of us\u2014is signing up to commitments that recognizes the challenges we all share and the responsibility that impacts on all of our nations. And that will take all of our nations\u2014and this is\u2014I've learned by significant experience\u2014it's going to take all of our nations working together in partnership to address this migration issue.\n\nThe past few years, the global economic crisis triggered by COVID-19 pandemic, and now made worse by Russia's war in Ukraine and the political turmoil from auto\u2014from\u2014excuse me, autocracies, regimes in our region, has led to record levels of migration, not just to the United States. Colombia has hosted millions of refugees from Venezuela. Right now migrants make up as much as 10 percent of the population of Costa Rica.\n\nAnd no nation should bear this responsibility alone, in my view\u2014our view. The economic futures depend on one another\u2014each of our futures depend on one another. And our security is linked in ways that I don't think most people in my country fully understand, and maybe not in your countries as well. Our common humanity demands that we care for our neighbors by working together.\n\nThe Los Angeles Declaration is built around four core pillars: first, stability and assistance, making sure communities that are welcoming refugees can afford to care for them, to educate them in their education, medical care, shelter, and job opportunities; second, increasing pathways for legal migration throughout the region as well as protections for refugees; third, working together to implement a more humane and coordinated border management systems; and finally, making sure we're working together to respond to emergencies.\n\nYou know, we know that safe, orderly, and legal migration is good for all our economies. But we need to halt the dangerous and unlawful ways people are migrating and the dangerous ways. Unlawful migration is not acceptable, and we'll secure our borders, including through innovative, coordinated actions with our regional partners.\n\nWorking these efforts simultaneously though\u2014humane policies that secure borders and support people\u2014representing groundbreaking, integrated new approaches. It addresses the needs of vulnerable migrants and the needs of countries hosting those migrants. That's why it has the support of the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees and the International Organization for Migration. And that's why so many nations\u2014again, 20, representing the entire migration route from Chile to Canada\u2014were eager to sign up to be part of this shared solution and have stepped up with their own major commitments.\n\nI particularly want to thank President Chaves of Costa Rica and President Lasso\u2014who you'll hear from in a minute\u2014of Ecuador for your new commitments to support and protect migrants in your countries so you have the chance to stay and begin to rebuild your lives where they are.\n\nAnd like many others, countries and the United States are stepping up with significant commitments as well. To help our partners in the region continue to welcome refugees and migrants, we're providing economic support. For example, more than $300 million in new funding for humanitarian assistance for countries in the region so when migrants arrive on their doorstep, they can provide a place to stay, make sure migrants can see a doctor, find opportunities to work so they don't have to undertake the dangerous journey north.\n\nAnd we're going to provide millions more, including through the World Bank, to support countries and communities that are carrying the greatest responsibility for migrants. For example, Colombia received $800 million last year\u2014not enough, but $800 million, that will help respond to the influx of refugees from Venezuela. And there's more we'll do, working with the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.\n\nWe're also expanding opportunities for people to come to the United States lawfully. In the next 2 years, we'll resettle 20,000 refugees from the region. In addition, we recently resumed the Cuban Family Reunification Program\u2014Parole Program. We're resuming increasing access to the Haitian Family Reunification Parole Program, with a goal of admitting 20,000 per year per country.\n\nAnd on this jobs front, our Department of Agriculture is launching a pilot program, funded by the American Rescue Plan, to help American farmers bring in seasonal agricultural workers from northern Central America, countries under the H-2A visa program to improve conditions for all workers. The program was designed in cooperation with the United Farm Workers and through the close consultation with farmers, farmworkers, unions, and other stakeholders.\n\nWe're also dedicated to an additional 11,500 H-2B nonagricultural temporary work visas to open opportunities for workers from Haiti and northern\u2014north Central American countries. Mexico, Guatemala, Canada, and Spain are also making commitments today to expand labor pathways to their countries as well.\n\nAnd in addition to securing our border and bringing order to the asylum processing in the United States, the Department of Homeland Security is leading a first-of-its-kind campaign to disrupt human smuggling in the region. If you prey on desperate and vulnerable migrants for profit, we are coming for you. We are coming after you.\n\nIn the first 2 months of our antismuggling campaign, the United States has worked with our partner nations to raid stash houses, impound vehicles used smuggling operation\u2014for use for smuggling operations, and we made more than 1,800 arrests. And as we speak, Mexico and the United States are conducting what is known as mirror patrols: joint operations to interdict criminals attempting to illegally move drugs and migrants across our borders.\n\nThis is just a start. There's\u2014much more work remains, to state the obvious. Every country needs to work together to maintain a humane and orderly immigration process, to invest in securing the borders, screening and registering migrants who enter their countries, and repatriating those that do not qualify to remain.\n\nI hope more countries will see the potential for joining the Los Angeles Declaration. And I want to thank all of my fellow leaders on this stage for committing to this historic new vision for our region.\n\nAnd now I'd like to invite President Lasso of Ecuador to say a few words. And thank you all very, very much for your patience.",
