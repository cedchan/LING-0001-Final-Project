    "text": " \n\nThe President. \u2014\u2014and I've got to say that, you know, having been to, unfortunately, a lot of\u2014like many of us have\u2014a lot of disaster sites because of natural disasters, it's\u2014what you're doing, in coordination among you all, has been just admirable. It really is impressive.\n\nAnd so I just want to say thanks and listen and find out what I can do as President and what I can unleash, in terms of help, for whatever you need.\n\nThe Governor and the mayor have been completely open with me, asked whatever they\u2014whatever they've asked, I think we've been able to deliver. And I think there's more that we can do, including\u2014I think I have the power\u2014and we'll know shortly that\u2014to be able to pick up a hundred percent of the cost for the county and the State for 30 days.\n\nMayor Daniella Levine Cava of Miami-Dade, Florida. Oh, my goodness, Mr. President.\n\nThe President. I think I'm quite sure I can do that. And so we're going to do that.\n\nAnd there's going to be a lot\u2014you all know it because a lot of you have been through it as well\u2014there's going to be a lot of pain and anxiety and suffering and even need for psychological help in the days and months that follow.\n\nAnd so we're not going anywhere.\n\nMayor Levine Cava. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nThe President. No, for real. But, again, I just want to, you know, start the day, if I could, but getting as thorough briefing as you're able to give me, and tell me what you need. And that goes for both the Senators and the Congresswoman and anyone in Florida, just to pick up the phone to the Oval. For real. I'm not joking about it.\n\nAnd I think the Gov will tell you\u2014anything you ask for, we got. And we have another group of teams coming from FEMA today. How many people will it be?\n\nFederal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Bennett Criswell. At the end of the day, there should about 500 on the ground.\n\nThe President. Five hundred on the ground.\n\nSo, again, this is your show. We just want to make sure that whatever you need\u2014and you know, including\u2014well, anyway, I'm talking too much. Why don't I\u2014I want to hear from you guys.\n\nMayor Levine Cava. All right. Well, Mr. President, we cannot thank you enough for being here with us, for showing your extraordinary support from day one. You called me that morning. We hustled into a little room in the Family Reunification Center so I could take the call, and you said whatever we need. And I said, \"Bring FEMA,\" and here they are, on the ground.\n\n \n\nSo I\u2014we have a briefing for you. And I want to start with our Governor. And I want to thank you, Governor DeSantis. Your team has been amazing, but you personally have been amazing. You've been a steady, calming, reassuring, but forceful voice every step of the way. And it's been a pleasure to partner with you, truly. Thank you. Thank you.\n\nGovernor Ronald D. DeSantis of Florida. Well, if I could\u2014\u2014\n\nThe President. Let me say just one more thing. You know what's good about this\u2014the way you've cooperated? We're letting the Nation know we can cooperate.\n\nMayor Levine Cava. Yes, sir. That's right.\n\nThe President. And when it's really important\u2014\u2014\n\nMayor Levine Cava. That's right.\n\nThe President. \u2014\u2014when it's really important\u2014I was talking to Debbie about it on the way down\u2014we come together. This is life and death.\n\nAnd so I don't think\u2014I just got back from about 12 days in Europe. They wonder whether we can do this. And you're doing it. I mean, just the simple act of everybody doing whatever needs to be done is a\u2014and it really makes a difference, Gov.\n\nGov. DeSantis. Well, thank you, Mr. President. And you've recognized the severity of this tragedy from day one. And you've been very supportive.\n\nWe, in Florida\u2014you know, you'll drive up and down these coastal roads, you'll see these buildings. And I've driven by that building, probably never thought twice. And then, something like this happens, and you recognize in each individual unit there's an amazing story.\n\nAnd lives have been shattered irrevocably as a result of this. We've already identified, unfortunately, fatalities\u2014people who've been 92 years old, have been a matriarch of a wonderful family. We have families with kids missing. And we even have young newlyweds who hadn't even been married a year who were in the tower when it collapsed.\n\nAnd so the cooperation has been great. The local\u2014both the municipal and the county have been fantastic. And you guys have not only been supportive at the Federal level, but we've had no bureaucracy. When we're dealing with FEMA, we're literally getting requests routed from local to State to Federal in no time\u2014\u2014\n\nThe President. I promise you, there will be none.\n\nGov. DeSantis. \u2014\u2014and the approval is happening. Yes.\n\n \n\nBut I can tell you this: We're not going to stop until we identify everybody and until we do what we need to do. So thank you, Mr. President.\n\nMayor Levine Cava. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to acknowledge the leadership of the First Lady, Casey DeSantis, as well, who is very, very focused on children and mental health issues and is bringing that agenda to our discussions. And of course, we've been including all of that, as you'll learn from the briefings. But we know how important First Ladies are\u2014 \u2014so we just wanted to be sure to give a shout out.\n\n ",
