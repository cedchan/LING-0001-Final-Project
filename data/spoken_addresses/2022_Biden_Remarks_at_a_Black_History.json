    "text": "The President. Well, Cateo, I tell you what, you didn't know there\u2014we have a little ongoing thing in the administration.\n\nAs you've mentioned, there are a fair number of African Americans in high places in my administration, but\u2014and I'm always hearing about Howard\u2014great school; I'm hearing about Morgan men; I'm hearing about\u2014you know, all these other things. But I keep talking about it: Delaware State. \n\nAnd although I went to the University of Delaware, I tell you\u2014there's an old expression: \"I tell you who brung me to the dance.\" Delaware State University is in the southern\u2014the middle of my State\u2014in Dover, Delaware. And the lower\u2014we have the eighth largest Black population in America, as a percent of the population. And the lower two counties are fairly conservative compared to the northern county.\n\nAnd I operated out of Delaware State for a significant portion of my career and campaign, as the gentlewoman from the State of Delaware can tell you. \n\nAnd there was a guy named Tony Allen who used to work for me\u2014worked for me for years. He went out, and he got his Ph.D. Then he left and became a president. You know, he's now\u2014Tony, stand up\u2014president of Delaware State University.\n\nAudience member. Yeah, Tony!\n\nThe President. I learned a long time, from good friends of mine in Delaware in the civil rights community, that if you want to know where the real power in America lies, it's in the Divine Nine. We're the only administration in history that actually has an office. Right, Jim? We have a Divine Nine office. So I understand\u2014I understand, as they say, who \"brung me to the dance.\"\n\nAnd all kidding aside, you're going to be incredible, old buddy. You're going to do well. You're going to do very well.\n\nAnd you know, there is a\u2014I don't know if they've been introduced, but my Secretary of Defense\u2014Secretary Austin\u2014stand up. My Secretary of Housing, Secretary Fudge. My Administrator\u2014the guy who's running and taking care of the EPA and all the rest\u2014from Carolinas\u2014[ laughter ]\u2014the Administrator, Regan. And Acting Director of OMB\u2014the woman who has all\u2014controls all the money\u2014 \u2014Shalanda\u2014Shalanda Young.\n\nAnd a woman who\u2014I really mean it\u2014has let the whole world know who we are. No, really. A woman who has been so incredibly effective in her job. But it wasn't until recently\u2014until the outrage of Putin and Soviet Union\u2014and the Soviet Union\u2014trying to reestablish the Soviet Union, basically, but\u2014and Russia. To hear her, to listen to her run the debates on\u2014at the Security Council, as well as the General Assembly at the United Nations\u2014Linda Greenhouse\u2014Thomas-Greenfield.\n\nAnd a woman who knows a little bit about the economy\u2014Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Cecilia\u2014[ laughter ]\u2014I kid her all the time, being from Princeton, but\u2014[ laughter ]\u2014 . Cecilia, congratulations. Thank you.\n\nAnd, Mr. Secretary\u2014I'm talking about Cateo right now\u2014[ laughter ]\u2014I think they're ready to elect you anything you want to be, pal. \n\nLook, I want to welcome everyone to the White House. This has been\u2014it's been a long drought, the last year and a half, not being able to have not just Black History Month, we weren't\u2014not able to have any gathering here at the White House of any crowd at all. And it's good to have you back. It's wonderful to be able to host this event in person.\n\nAnd it's great to see so many friends. If I begin calling out\u2014calling the roll, we'll be all night here, and I don't want to do that. But so many significant leaders who have changed the face of America sitting in the audience, not on this stage. So thank you all so very, very, very much.\n\nMy name is Joe Biden. I'm Jill Biden's husband. [ Laughter ] As you've probably figured out, I can't dance. [ Laughter ] I do it, but I ain't good at it. [ Laughter ] And\u2014[ laughter ]\u2014oh man, you have great opportunities now, don't you, Jilly. \n\nTomorrow I'm going to be delivering the State of the Union Address. And today I simply want to thank you for all you've done for me, for all of the country. So much has been accomplished in the people in this room.\n\nBlack History Month is more than a celebration, it's a powerful, powerful reminder that Black history is American history. Black culture is American culture. Black stories are essentially an ongoing story of America. I see it every day with the Vice President and the incredible job she's doing. We see it in the Black members of the Cabinet\u2014my Cabinet and the White House staff\u2014and who are here today, who serve to defend the Nation; protect the planet; build the economy; deliver housing, jobs, and justice. And we see it the tireless, heroic efforts of the Congressional Black Caucus. And I want to\u2014I'm going to embarrass him now, but I want\u2014the former chairman of the Black Caucus has come over to help me run things. Cedric, stand up. Let everybody see you.\n\nI used to\u2014I never played golf until I was 46 years old. I got to be pretty good. Then I\u2014and I asked Cedric to help me in my campaign. Then I played golf, and he beat the hell out of me. I wish I had never done it. I don't know.\n\nAnd so many State and local leaders and faith leaders here\u2014lawyers, educators\u2014that are here today.\n\nAnd of course, we see another first in the nomination of Ketanji\u2014well, you saw her. I guess you saw Justice Brown\u2014Justice Brown Jackson, who is on the\u2014from the\u2014on the Circuit Court of Appeals right now. She is an incredible woman. This is a woman who graduated magna cum laude from Harvard. She graduated\u2014she was editor of the Law Review. She has done so many other things.\n\nBut I want to make it clear: Not only is she is eminently qualified, there were so many others I had to choose from. I can tell you, Jim\u2014Jim is\u2014supported all the nominees, but the one he most supported\u2014as soon as the outcome is\u2014I've already nominated her to be on the Circuit Court of Appeals, the second highest court in the Nation.\n\nBut Judge Jackson is going to be an outstanding Justice. She's part of an incredible group of Black women who I've nominated to the Federal bench. We've nominated more Black women to the Federal bench than any administration in the history of the United States of America. Well, I made that commitment when I was running for President, and I've tried to keep that commitment my whole career.\n\nYou know, and the first Executive order I signed when I came into office\u2014and it was with Cedric's help. I sat down, put pencil to paper\u2014or pen to paper, and signed a\u2014I instructed every single element of my administration, every department, from the Defense Department to the\u2014to the Justice Department and on, that equity should be the center of our\u2014all of what we do. And we did that in the COVID-19 response. Remember at the beginning, everyone was concerned whether or not, as usual, African Americans would be left behind.\n\nWell, we helped Black\u2014they\u2014we helped raise the vaccination rate among Black Americans and bring it on par with White adults. All\u2014the same across the board. And I want to thank the members of the Black Coalition Against COVID represented here today as well. And I also want to thank Derrick Jones, also known as D-Nice\u2014 \u2014for being\u2014stand up, man. Let them see who you are. He provided the soundtrack of hope to keep our spirits up during the worst days of that pandemic. And thank you, thank you, thank you, man.\n\nYou know, when I took office, I said, \"the American story depends not on\" how many of us\u2014\"any one of us, not on some of us, but on all of us.\" \"On all of us.\" So we're investing in all of us. So many of you here helped enact the American Rescue Plan to deliver immediate economic relief with Rescue checks, to tax cuts, to eliminate\u2014and the estimate is that we've cut Black poverty by over 30 percent. We've reduced child poverty by more than 50 percent in the Black community. The American Rescue Plan also included historic funding that allowed cities and States to invest in community violence intervention programs and keep neighborhoods safe.\n\nLook, you were critical in getting the infrastructure law passed\u2014a bipartisan bill that's going to get\u2014that's going to do so much. It's going to replace decades of disinvestment in the United States of America. A commitment to reconnecting communities and people and job opportunities. Lots\u2014so much of what they\u2014the early investments in highways and in interstates\u2014they cut neighborhoods in half. They divided things. We can put it back together again.\n\nClean water. High-speed internet. It's going to\u2014we're going to eliminate every lead pipe in America so our children don't have to worry about whether they're drinking poison water, in effect. And as part of that law, we made Minority Business Development Agency permanent and seeded it with $110 million so Black businesses can get the capital they need to grow. And I'm also proud to be joined by Opal Lee, when\u2014we made the Juneteenth the first Federal holiday in the last 40 years. It's good to see Ms. Lee here.\n\nYou know, we've made landmark investments of $5.8 billion in Historic Black Colleges and Universities not just because of\u2014we've got some serious advocates for Howard and Morehouse\u2014[ laughter ]\u2014and other HBCUs you've heard of, like Delaware and others. But all kidding\u2014but all kidding aside, because they offer so much promise to the Nation\u2014so much promise.\n\nIt's good to see the many HBCU leaders here tonight, including Dr. Devona Williams of Delaware State; Tony Allen\u2014I mean, Tony of Delaware State, Chair of the Board of Advisers of HBCUs. And look\u2014and I want all of you to know, we're ready to closely investigate the cowardly, un-American bomb threats against HBCUs. That's underway.\n\nWe have so much more to do as a nation on making everyday things more accessible and affordable. As my friend Jim Clyburn says, \"That's the test of whether government delivers.\" Are they accessible and affordable? Prescription drugs. Childcare. Housing. Make health care more affordable and make progress on Black maternal health, something that Kamala has been leading the effort on. To end cancer as we know it by putting science and technology to work to address the inequities in testing and diagnosis and access to care.\n\nAnd you know, we've got work to do to deliver police and criminal justice reform as well. Even though Congress isn't acting, we are making changes in Federal law enforcement policies: banning chokeholds, restrictions on no-knock warrants, requirements on Federal\u2014for Federal agents to wear and activate their body cameras, ending the Department of Justice's use of private prisons.\n\nAll of this is being\u2014is happening. And the Justice Department has opened pattern-and-practice investigations for systemic police misconduct in several key police departments in the country. We've just got to stay on it. With your help, we're going to keep pushing on this.\n\nAnd we\u2014we're protecting our country's threshold liberty, the sacred right to vote, which I've never seen as under such attack. You know, it's always made it harder for Blacks to vote, but this is trying to be able to figure out how to keep the Black vote, when it occurs, from even counting.\n\nOver the past year, we've directed Federal agencies to promote access to voting. We've\u2014we've appointed top civil rights advocates to help the U.S. Department of Justice, which is\u2014has doubled the number of voting rights enforcement on\u2014enforcement folks on their staff. And, again, we call on Congress: Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Pass the Freedom To Vote Act. We can do this. The American people agree with us\u2014Black and White, Hispanic and all.\n\nLet me conclude with this. Look, I don't want to take much more of your time, but let me conclude with this: I know progress can be slow and frustrating. But I also know it's possible if we work together, if we keep the faith, if we remember the changes and the charges that have passed down to us from all those who came before us, many sitting in this room right now.\n\nYou've heard\u2014you know, as you've heard, we had a wonderful exhibit downstairs celebrating Black History Month. And I want to thank Lonnie Bunch and the Smithsonian, as well as the Library of Congress for their\u2014giving us access to their collection.\n\nWhen I introduced Judge on Friday out in the hallway here, I thought about the display that holds the signature of the judicial oath of office sworn and signed by Thurgood Marshall himself. It was Justice Marshall who reminded us, in a speech shortly before he died, and I quote, \"America can do better because America has no choice but to do better.\" \"America has no choice but to do better.\" It's a powerful reminder of the history of the journey of America and the power each of us hold to write a more just and hopeful chapter. And I really mean it.\n\nI am more optimistic about our chances to bring equity to this country than we ever have before now. And if you wonder about it, just take a look\u2014take a look at the difference\u2014the reason I have so much hope is the younger generation. Those folks being\u2014they're in, from grade school through 30 years of age. Look at what's going on. Look at how they act with one another. There's not this isolation. There is everything you see\u2014everything you see from television commercials, down to how we act with one another. We have so much going for us. We got to just let them have their shot.\n\nFolks, I want to thank you all for being here. I really mean it. I want to thank you for all you've done, all that we can do, and being committed that we're going to do so much more.\n\nSo thank you, thank you, thank you. May God bless you all. Thank you.\n\n \n\nRussia's Attack on Ukraine \n\nQ. Mr. President, should Americans be worried about nuclear war?\n\nThe President. No.",
