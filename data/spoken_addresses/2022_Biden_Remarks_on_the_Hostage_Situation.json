    "text": "The President. Hey, folks. With regard to Texas and the synagogue, I spoke this morning with the Attorney General and\u2014to get a rundown on\u2014he said there's overwhelming cooperation with the local authorities and the FBI, and they did one hell of a job.\n\nThis was an act of terror. This was an act of terror. And it not only was related to someone who had been arrested, I might add, 15 years ago and been in jail for 10 years\u2014the idea that it was something new.\n\nAnd they did just a great job.\n\nI also told him that I wanted to make sure we got the word out to synagogues and places of worship that we're not going to tolerate this, that we have this capacity to deal with the assaults on\u2014particularly the anti-Semitism that has grown up.\n\nAnd so\u2014and I'll be talking with\u2014I put a call into the rabbi. We missed one another on the way up here. And\u2014but they should rest assured that we are focused. We are focused. The Attorney General is focused on making sure that we deal with these kinds of acts.\n\nAnd thank God\u2014thank God we have such a professional FBI, as well as\u2014the local cooperation, I was told, was incredible. It was seamless. So I just wanted to let you know that.\n\nOkay?\n\nSuspect's Access to Weapons \n\nQ. Mr. President, how could this man have gotten weapons? There's reports that he's only been in the country for a couple of\u2014\u2014\n\nThe President. Well\u2014\u2014\n\nQ. \u2014\u2014weeks.\n\nThe President. \u2014\u2014allegedly\u2014I\u2014we\u2014I don't have all the facts, nor does the Attorney General. But, allegedly, the assertion was he got the weapons on the street. He purchased them when he landed. And it turns out there apparently were no bombs that we know of. That\u2014you know, he said that there are bombs he has as well.\n\nBut he\u2014apparently, he spent the first night in a homeless shelter. I don't have all the detail yet, so I'm reluctant to go into more\u2014much more detail.\n\nBut\u2014and, allegedly, he purchased it on the street. Now what that means, I don't know. Whether he purchased it from an individual in a homeless shelter or a homeless community, or whether\u2014because that's where he said he was\u2014it's hard to tell. I just don't know.\n\nGun Control \n\nQ. \u2014ramifications for the push to\u2014on\u2014to ensure that guns are not available?\n\nThe President. Well, no\u2014well, it does, but it also doesn't. What the guns are\u2014we should be\u2014the idea of background checks are critical. But you can't stop something like this if someone is on the street buying something from somebody else on the street. Except that there's too\u2014there's so many guns that have been sold of late; it's just ridiculous. And it's because of the failure of us to focus as hard as we should and as consistent as we should on gun purchases, gun sales, ghost guns, and a whole range of things that I'm trying to do.\n\nMotivations of the Suspect \n\nQ. Mr. President, do you know more about the motivations of the person?\n\nThe President. No, I don't. I\u2014there's speculation, but I'm not going to get into that. I will\u2014I'm going to have a press conference on Wednesday, and I'll be happy to go into detail of what I know in detail at that time.\n\nQ. Do you know why he targeted that specific synagogue, Mr. President?\n\nThe President. Well, no, I don't. We don't have\u2014I don't think there is sufficient information to know about why he targeted that synagogue, why he insisted on the release of someone who's been in prison for over 10 years, why he was engaged\u2014why he was using anti-Semitic and anti-Israeli comments. I\u2014we just don't have enough facts.\n\nThank you.",
