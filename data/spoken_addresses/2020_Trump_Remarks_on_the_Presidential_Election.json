    "text": "Good evening. I'd like to provide the American people with an update on our efforts to protect the integrity of our very important 2020 election. If you count the legal votes, I easily win. If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us. If you count the votes that came in late\u2014we're looking at them very strongly. But a lot of votes came in late.\n\nI've already decisively won many critical States, including massive victories in Florida, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, to name just a few. We won these and many other victories despite historic election interference from big media, big money, and big tech.\n\nAs everybody saw, we won by historic numbers. And the pollsters got it knowingly wrong. They got it knowingly wrong. We had polls that were so ridiculous, and everybody knew that at the time. There was no blue wave that they predicted. They thought there was going to be a big blue wave; that was false. That was done for suppression reasons. But instead, there was a big red wave. And it's been properly acknowledged, actually, by the media. They were, I think, very impressed, but that was after the fact. That doesn't do us any good.\n\nWe kept the Senate, despite having twice as many seats to defend as Democrats. And in a really\u2014much more competitive States, we've\u2014we did a fantastic job with the Senate. I think we're very proud of what's happened there. We had many more seats to defend.\n\nThey spent almost $200 million on Senate races in South Carolina and Kentucky alone\u2014two races\u2014and hundreds of millions of dollars overall against us. At the national level, our opponents' major donors were Wall Street bankers and special interests. Our major donors were police officers, farmers, everyday citizens. Yet, for the first time ever, we lost zero races in the House. I was talking to Kevin McCarthy today. He said he couldn't believe it: zero races. Very unusual thing. Zero. And actually won many new seats with, I think, many more on the way.\n\nThis was also the year of the Republican woman. More Republican women were elected to Congress than ever before. That's a great achievement. I won the largest share of non-White voters of any Republican in 60 years, including historic numbers of Latino, African American, Asian American, and Native American voters\u2014the largest ever in our history. We grew our party by 4 million voters, the greatest turnout in Republican Party history.\n\nDemocrats are the party of the big donors, the big media, the big tech, it seems. And Republicans have become the party of the American worker, and that's what's happened. And we're also, I believe, the party of inclusion.\n\nAs everyone now recognizes, media polling was election interference, in the truest sense of that word, by powerful special interests. These really phony polls\u2014I have to call them phony polls, fake polls\u2014were designed to keep our voters at home, create the illusion of momentum for Mr. Biden, and diminish Republicans' ability to raise funds. They were what's called \"suppression polls.\" Everyone knows that now. And it's never been used to the extent that it's been used on this last election.\n\nTo highlight just a few examples: The day before election, Quinnipiac\u2014which was wrong on every occasion that I know of\u2014had Joe Biden up by 5 points in Florida, and they were off by 8.4 points. And I won Florida easily. Easily. So they had me losing Florida by a lot, and I ended up winning Florida by a lot. Other than that, they were very accurate. They had him up 4 points in Ohio, and they were off by 12.2 points. And I also won Ohio\u2014the great State of Ohio\u2014very easily.\n\nThe Washington Post had Biden up 17 points in Wisconsin, and it was basically even. They were off by about 17 points, and they knew that. They're not stupid people. They knew that. Suppression.\n\nThere are now only a few States yet to be decided in the Presidential race. The voting apparatus of those States are run, in all cases, by Democrats. We were winning in all the key locations by a lot, actually. And then, our numbers started miraculously getting whittled away in secret, and they wouldn't allow legally permissible observers. We went to court, in a couple of instances, and we were able to get the observers put in. And when the observers got there, they wanted them 60, 70 feet away, 80 feet, 100 feet away\u2014or outside the building to observe people inside the building.\n\nAnd we won a case\u2014a big case. And we have others happening. There are a lot of\u2014lots of litigation. Even beyond our litigation, there's tremendous amount of litigation generally because of how unfair this process was, and I predicted that. I've been talking about mail-in voting for a long time. It's really destroyed our system.\n\nIt's a corrupt system. And it makes people corrupt even if they aren't by nature, but they become corrupt; it's too easy. They want to find out how many votes they need, and then they seem to be able to find them. They wait and wait, and then they find them.\n\nAnd you see that on election night. We were ahead in votes in North Carolina by a lot\u2014tremendous number of votes. And we're still ahead by a lot, but not as many, because they're finding ballots all of a sudden. \"Oh, we have some mail-in ballots.\"\n\nIt's amazing how those mail-in ballots are so one-sided too. I know that it's supposed to be to the advantage of the Democrats, but in all cases, they're so one-sided.\n\nWe were up by nearly 700,000 votes in Pennsylvania. I won Pennsylvania by a lot, and that gets whittled down to\u2014I think they said now we're up by 90,000 votes. And they'll keep coming and coming and coming. They find them all over. And they don't want us to have any observers, although we won a court case. The judge said you have to have observers.\n\nLikewise, in Georgia\u2014and they're appealing. Actually, they're appealing. We won a case that we want people to watch, and we want observers, and they're actually appealing, which is sort of interesting. I wonder why they'd appeal\u2014that all we want to do is have people watch as they do the vote tabulations.\n\nLikewise, in Georgia, I won by a lot\u2014a lot\u2014with a lead of over\u2014getting close to 300,000 votes on election night in Georgia. And by the way, got whittled down, and now it's getting to be to a point where I'll go from winning by a lot to perhaps being even down a little bit.\n\nIn Georgia, a pipe burst in a faraway location, totally unrelated to the location of what was happening, and they stopped counting for four hours, and a lot of things happened. The election apparatus in Georgia is run by Democrats.\n\nWe also had margins of 300,000 in Michigan. We were way up in Michigan, won the State. And in Wisconsin, we did likewise fantastically well. And that got whittled down. Every\u2014in every case, they got whittled down.\n\nToday we're on track to win Arizona. We only need to carry, I guess, 55 percent of the remaining vote\u201455 percent margins. And that's a margin that we've significantly exceeded. So we'll see what happens with that, but we're on track to do okay in Arizona. Our goal is to defend the integrity of the election. We'll not allow the corruption to steal such an important election or any election, for that matter. And we can't allow silence\u2014anybody to silence our voters and manufacture results.\n\nI've never had\u2014I've been doing a lot of public things for a long time; I've never had anything that's been as inspirational by people\u2014calling, talking, sending things to us. I've never seen such\u2014such love and such affection and such spirit as I've seen for this. People know what's happening, and they see what's happening, and it's before their eyes.\n\nAnd there are many instances which will be reported very shortly. There's tremendous litigation going on. And this is a case where they're trying to steal an election, they're trying to rig an election, and we can't let that happen. Detroit and Philadelphia\u2014known as two of the most corrupt political places anywhere in our country, easily\u2014cannot be responsible for engineering the outcome of a Presidential race\u2014a very important Presidential race.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Democrats have gone to the State Supreme Court to try and ban our election observers and very strongly. Now, we won the case, but they're going forward. They don't want anybody in there. They don't want anybody watching them as they count the ballots, and I can't imagine why. There's absolutely no legitimate reason why they would not want to have people watching this process, because if it's straight, they would be\u2014they should be proud of it. Instead, they're trying, obviously, to commit fraud. There's no question about that.\n\nIn Philadelphia, observers have been kept far away\u2014very far away\u2014so far that people are using binoculars to try and see, and there's been tremendous problems caused. They put paper on all of the windows so you can't see in, and the people that are banned are very unhappy and become somewhat violent.\n\nThe 11th Circuit ruled that, in Georgia, the votes have been in by election day\u2014that they should be in by election day, and they weren't. Votes are coming in after election day. And they had a ruling already that you have to have the votes in by election day. To the best of my knowledge, votes should be in by election day, and they didn't do that.\n\nDemocrat officials never believed they could win this election honestly. I really believe that. That's why they did the mail-in ballots, where there's tremendous corruption and fraud going on. That's why they mailed out tens of millions of unsolicited ballots without any verification measures whatsoever. And I've told everybody that these things would happen, because I've seen it happen. I watched a lot of different elections before they decided to go with this big, massive election with tens of millions of ballots going out to everybody, in many cases, totally unsolicited.\n\nThis was unprecedented in American history. This was by design. Despite years of claiming to care about the election security, they refuse to include any requirement to verify signatures, identities, or even determine whether they're eligible or ineligible to vote. People are walking in that they have no idea; they're just taking numbers. They're writing down things\u2014the workers\u2014and doing a lot of bad things. And we have a lot of information coming and litigation that you'll see that will shake even you people up, and you've seen it all.\n\nThe officials overseeing the counting in Pennsylvania and other key States are all part of a corrupt Democrat machine that you've written about\u2014and, for a long time, you've been writing about the corrupt Democrat machine. I went to school there, and I know a lot about it. It hasn't changed. It's a long time ago, and it hasn't changed. It's gotten worse.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, partisan Democrats have allowed ballots in the State to be received 3 days after the election, and we think much more than that. And they are counting those without even postmarks or any identification whatsoever. So you don't have postmarks; you don't have identification. There have been a number of disturbing irregularities across the Nation. Our campaign has been denied access to observe any counting in Detroit. Detroit is another place.\n\nSo you don't have postmarks; you don't have identification. There have been a number of disturbing irregularities across the Nation. Our campaign has been denied access to observe any counting in Detroit. Detroit is another place\u2014and I wouldn't say has the best reputation for election integrity.\n\nPoll workers in Michigan were duplicating ballots. But when our observers attempted to challenge the activity, those poll workers jumped in front of the volunteers to block their view so that they couldn't see what they were doing, and it became a little bit dangerous.\n\nOne major hub for counting ballots in Detroit covered up the windows, again, with large pieces of cardboard. And so they wanted to protect and block the counting area. They didn't want anybody seeing the counting, even though these were observers who are legal observers that were supposed to be there.\n\nIn Detroit, there were hours of unexplained delay in delivering many of the votes for counting. The final batch did not arrive until 4 in the morning and\u2014even though the polls closed at 8 o'clock. So they brought it in, and the batches came in, and nobody knew where they came from. We've also been denied access to observe in critical places in Georgia.\n\nIn multiple swing States, counting was halted for hours and hours on election night, with results withheld from major Democrat-run locations, only to appear later. And they certainly appeared, and they all had the name \"Biden\" on them or just about all\u2014I think almost all. They all had the name \"Biden\" on them, which is a little strange.\n\nI challenge Joe and every Democrat to clarify that they only want legal votes. Because they talk about votes, and I think they should use the word \"legal\"\u2014\"legal votes.\" \"We want every legal vote counted.\" And I want every legal vote counted. We want openness and transparency\u2014no secret count rooms, no mystery ballots, no illegal votes being cast after election day.\n\nYou have election day, and the laws are very strong on that. You have an election day. And they don't want votes cast after election day, and they want the process to be an honest one. It's so important. We want an honest election, and we want an honest count, and we want honest people working back there because it's a very important job.\n\nSo that's the way this country is going to win. That's the way the United States will win. And we think we will win the election very easily. We think there's going to be a lot of litigation, because we have so much evidence, so much proof. And it's going to end up, perhaps, at the highest court in the land. We'll see. But we think there'll be a lot of litigation because we can't have an election stolen by\u2014like this.\n\nAnd I tell you, I would\u2014I have been talking about this for many months with all of you. And I've said very strongly that mail-in ballots are going to end up being a disaster. Small elections were a disaster. Small, very easy-to-handle elections were disastrous.\n\nThis is a large-scale version, and it's getting worse and worse every day. We're hearing stories that are horror stories\u2014absolute horror stories. And we can't let that happen to the United States of America. It's not a question of who wins\u2014Republican, Democrat; Joe, myself. We can't let that happen to our country. We can't be disgraced by having something like this happen.\n\nSo it will be, hopefully, cleared up, maybe soon; I hope soon. But it will probably go through a process\u2014a legal process. And, as you know, I've claimed certain States, and he's claiming States. So we can both claim the States, but ultimately, I have a feeling judges are going to have to rule. But there's been a lot of shenanigans, and we can't stand for that in our country. Thank you very much.",
