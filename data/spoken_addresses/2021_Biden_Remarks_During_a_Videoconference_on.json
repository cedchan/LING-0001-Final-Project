    "text": "The President. Well, thank you very much. That's a very generous introduction. I hope that's true, but I'm not so sure.\n\nLook, folks, first of all, I want to thank you all for this\u2014the faith community leaders getting together. And I want to thank my buddy, Cedric, for honchoing this for me and\u2014because we both believe that you have profound influence on not only your congregations, but on the public at large. You are the community leaders. And Jill and I want to send our warmest wishes to all of you, your families, your congregations, and your communities on this holiday and holy season.\n\nYou know, what I always find remarkable as one of my avocations is\u2014and I think I drive Cedric crazy and some of you crazy\u2014has been theology and comparative religion. And one of the interesting things\u2014think about the confluence of the\u2014this season marks remarkable confluence of holy days across a number of traditions.\n\nJill and I, we're looking forward to our Easter celebration, where we get to get together with our family. And because we've had the great honor of being vaccinated, we may be able to get together with some of them this Easter. And\u2014but Passover began last week. The Hindu holiday of Holi was last week. Ramadan is right around the corner.\n\nAnd you know it's not only a time of reverence and celebration, it's one of the most important opportunities of the year to connect with your congregations and with your communities. And all of the great confessional faiths have the same notion about the value of human beings and the value in that we're made in the image of God, and that's why all of you gotten involved in the way you have. And no one\u2014no one\u2014no one is not important; everyone is important.\n\nAnd so, you know, everybody is looking to you this season. They\u2014you know, they trust you. It's one of the most important opportunities of the year to connect with your congregations. And I hope that doesn't sound instructive; I don't mean to sound that way. I\u2014you know better than I do. But it's\u2014but to connect with your congregations and those in your community.\n\nAnd so, you know, I think they're looking to you this season. As I said, they trust you. And you have a chance to deliver not only a spiritual direction, but comfort and guidance; prayers of joy, love, reflection; you know, rebirth that's synonymous with these holidays. Because in the last year, you've been through\u2014we've been through an awful lot of tough, tough times, particularly all of you in the faith community.\n\nHow many times did you watch on a cell phone a parishioner having to say goodbye to his mother or father in a ward where they couldn't be there? A nurse holding up that phone. And all\u2014how many times have you lamented the fact that leaders in your faith community have not even been able to have the funerals that they deserve and the remembrance that is so important, because there's a finality? How many of you have not been able to, you know, be at the cemetery site and with the family? I mean\u2014and there's so many things that people look to you for comfort for.\n\nAnd you know, I said earlier this week, we're in a race against this virus, and the race is far from over. You know, it's\u2014we\u2014it's taken far too many moms and dads; sisters; brothers; you know, grandpops, grandmoms. You know. And they\u2014we put dreams and plans on hold, and it's kept us physically apart, which is not the instinct of human beings. They want to congregate. They want to be with other\u2014and they want to be with one another of like views, like conscience, like values.\n\nAnd so we all know many families are still going without a familiar comfort to the season. We know that, despite the progress we've made, this fight is far from over.\n\nWe also know that signs of hope have emerged. I was\u2014we were looking at a mass vaccination site out in\u2014I think it was in Arizona, and the nurse was talking to us\u2014virtual. And the nurse was saying that\u2014she said\u2014well, I was asking her how many shots had been given, and she said: \"These are shots of hope. These are shots of hope.\" Hope springs eternal. You're a source of so much hope.\n\nAnd more than a\u2014we've now given\u2014I'm very proud to say we've administered over 130 million shots. And 75 percent of all seniors now have received the shots, which is a drastic change and increases exponentially the prospect that they'll live out their lives in the way they anticipated. And you know, 100 million of those shots in fewer than 9 weeks, and more every day.\n\nAnd families are getting the financial relief they need so they can take a breath. I don't know how many of you have had to carry people who have been\u2014in your communities\u2014because they've been\u2014the food shortages\u2014the failure\u2014people getting thrown out of their apartments or not able to pay their mortgage.\n\nWell, with the legislation I was able to\u2014 \u2014with the help of Cedric and so many other people\u2014get passed, it has brought genuine relief, serious, serious relief to people. It's about, you know, \"What you do unto the least of my brethren, you do unto me.\" I mean, it's\u2014this is really\u2014it is significant.\n\nAnd also, you know, we launched a program to\u2014because, you know, this has been an unequal killer. It has focused mainly\u2014you know, the African American community; the Hispanic community; the AAP\u2014the Asian Pacific community. It has\u2014it has damaged them much more than others. They are three to four times more likely to die if they've gotten the COVID. And they're about the same percentage likely to get the COVID over the traditional\u2014the remainder of the white population. And so I've been\u2014we've set up, in our effort to deal with COVID and the COVID team we put together, a scientist who is nothing but racial equity to make sure we can get to the people.\n\nAnd by the way, I need not tell you all I come from a community that has a very large African American population, and I spent a lot of time in the Black church, because it does more for my community than most anything else. And I\u2014I don't know\u2014you know, I can remember discussions way back\u2014when I was a kid getting started in public life\u2014about how there was a distrust for\u2014for some docs and mass vaccination things.\n\nAnd even when we were\u2014I\u2014my wife put together an ability to get mammogram vans to go around communities. There's distrust because, you know, there have been experimentation on African Americans in World War II, so many things where the treatment has not been fair and decent.\n\nSo I wanted to make\u2014you know, Cedric and I want to make sure that this does not ever happen again. And we've been totally science-based. But you're trusted voices in the community. You know, this is the moment that the people you serve are looking for\u2014for direction, looking for some help.\n\nAnd we need to get the word out. And the word is that these vaccines are safe, I promise you. I promise you they're safe. That's why I've made sure to get one on television so people can see the President of the United States. Why would I take a vaccine that I thought wasn't safe? And they're safe.\n\nAnd\u2014but we also made it more available. One of the things we did\u2014and initially caused a little bit of a stir among some Governors\u2014but you know, we made vaccinations available to 17,000 local pharmacies because that's where people were most comfortable\u2014where they can go.\n\nAnd then, I've scaled that up to now 40,000 local pharmacies and stores you can get these shots. This is going to put vaccination sites within 5 miles of 90 percent of all Americans. We also have hundreds of mobile vehicles going out in rural and African American and Hispanic communities, because a lot of people that are older, they can't get to where they have to go.\n\nAnd the\u2014and Health and Human Services is making $3 billion in grants available for community groups within States to increase access at our federally run vaccination centers. We partner with faith-based organizations\u2014many of you on the phone, I'm sure\u2014to reverse the vaccine, you know, delay and make sure we can reserve appointments for members.\n\nAnd we're soon going to be in place where everybody\u2014every American will be able to get the vaccine and should get in line. There should be no restrictions based on age any longer because we're able to get over\u2014over\u2014you know, we've gotten millions and millions of shots\u2014vaccines available.\n\nSo look, the point I guess I'm trying to make is: The faith community\u2014as faith community leaders, you've been critical partners with us in our COVID response and our vaccine efforts already, including many of you on this call.\n\nWe're enormously grateful for all you've done, including help educate folks about the relief we're delivering through the Rescue Plan; the $1,400; money for childcare; the childcare * tax credit, which is\u2014we're reducing child poverty by 40 percent\u2014are cutting it in half, actually\u201450 percent. And because of what we've been able to do to provide funding for people who have children\u2014and anyway, it's a long\u2014I don't want\u2014I'm going on too long.\n\nBut we need you to spread the word. Let people in our communities, in your communities know how important it is to get everyone vaccinated when it's their turn. And soon, they'll just be able to just line up and just get their name on a list. And that's how we're going to defeat this virus. And that's how we're going to come together again in our communities, in our houses of worship, in my view.\n\nYou know, I know people think I'm kidding when I\u2014what I'm worried about now, as the scientists tell me, is that people are getting too cavalier\u2014where, you know, we're traveling a great deal, we're gathering in larger crowds\u2014and people aren't wearing their masks, aren't social distancing, aren't washing their hands. And you see that it's starting to spike in other areas again.\n\nSo we're not finished with this. So, you know\u2014and I don't, you know\u2014some people think that's an imposition on people's freedom. I think it's the\u2014a godly thing to do. Protect your brother and sister. That's what this is about. It's about protecting people. It's a patriotic duty I think we have.\n\nBut they're going to listen to your words more than they are me as President of the United States. When they're in your sanctuaries, you can talk to them about what we have to do, what's available, and not to be fearful\u2014not to be fearful getting the vaccine. And I've said, I think it's\u2014I guess I should say, and I'll conclude by saying: I think it's more than a patriotic duty; I think it's a moral duty. Put an end to the dark years behind us\u2014a dark year\u2014and do our part to spread the light in the spirit of all holidays of this spring season.\n\nI want to thank you all for what you're doing. I look forward to being able to get back into houses of worship and visit like I have in the past and will hope to do again.\n\nBut, in the meantime, God bless you all. Thank you for looking out for your\u2014our brethren. And I think we can get this done. But thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",
