    "text": "The President. Please. Thank you very much. Thank you. Please, sit down. Please. I've been to enough Senate caucuses and Democratic retreats to know that when the last speaker is up, you want to get the hell out of here\u2014 \u2014no matter who it is. But thank you.\n\nLook, folks, I may begin by saying that when I ran\u2014and a lot of you helped me; a lot of good people ran\u2014I made it clear I was running for three reasons, and\u2014because I had no intention of running for office again when I left the Vice Presidency. But when I saw those folks come out of those fields down in Charlottesville, carrying torches and singing Nazi slogans and carrying swastikas, and White supremacists, I decided to get engaged.\n\nThe point is this, I had a message, which I didn't consult with anybody about generating, to begin with, which was not viewed as being very saleable. The first was that I thought it was essential to literally restore the soul of this country\u2014a sense of decency and honor, a sense of\u2014a sense that you could trust one another\u2014just restore the soul of the country, because what we were seeing was not who we are. And among some of our Republicans, what they're saying is still not who we are.\n\nThe second thing I wanted to do that has been the essence of my whole career, from the time I ran 20 miles from here\u2014a 29-year-old kid for the Senate\u2014was that I wanted to rebuild the backbone of the country. And the backbone of the country is the working class and middle class. I'm so sick and tired of trickle-down. When the middle class does well, the poor have a way up and the wealthy do just fine. They do just fine.\n\nAnd the third thing, which a lot of you didn't like, I know: I thought we had to unify the country, because, ultimately, we are a democracy. And there needs to be\u2014for it to work, there has to be consensus. And the consensus, you got to get a majority. We've not been able to do that for a lot of the important things. That's why we have to continue to maintain our majority.\n\nThis off-year election, in my view, may be the most important off-year election in modern history. Because we know what happens: We know the fundamental change that shifts if we lose the House and Senate. The only thing I'll have then is a veto pen.\n\nAnd so, folks, I want to thank Nancy for your introduction, for your friendship all these years, Nance. And, Paul, thank you as well. And I want to thank\u2014the extraordinary job you've done delivering the omnibus, just like you delivered so many critical pieces of legislation last year.\n\nAnd Hakeem and Steny and Jim and Emanuel Cleaver and Pete, Congresswoman Katherine Clark and all of you out there: Let me first say that I want to thank you; thank you for the support you've provided Ukraine.\n\nI was on the phone today for a better part of an hour with Zelenskyy, who I speak to almost daily. The people of Ukraine have demonstrated a remarkable source of bravery and courage. But the security assistance that you've provided has been absolutely critical\u2014critical in their defense.\n\nSecond, I want to thank you for showing a unified front to the world. When Putin unleashed his assault, he thought he could divide NATO. He thought he could literally divide this country, the West, the United States\u2014in terms of the parties. I know a former Ambassador knows that out there. He thought he could divide Democrats and Republicans at home. But he failed. He failed.\n\nFor months, the United States has worked tirelessly to keep our allies and partners together. As our former Ambassador\u2014who you see on television a lot, thank God\u2014will tell you, I've spent literally hours and hours and hours and hours keeping the alliance together: the EU, NATO, and all of our allies, including our Asian allies. As a result, we've been able to ramp up our economic pressure on Putin and further isolate Russia on the global stage.\n\nThis morning, along with the G-7 nations\u2014in Germany, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom\u2014we moved\u2014which I know you wanted to do initially\u2014and Nancy, I drove her crazy\u2014on most-favored-nation status\u2014as we call it in the United States, \"permanent normal trade relations\"\u2014and eliminate them.\n\nBut, folks, I know I've occasionally frustrated you, but more important than us moving when we want to is making sure all of NATO is together\u2014is together. They have different vulnerabilities than we do. Just like in the oil embargo, a lot of them could not\u2014the only way I was\u2014it took, I think, you know, weeks to work out. I said, \"We're going to block oil, Russian oil and energy.\"\n\nWe consume 15 percent of it; they rely totally on it. Without Russian oil, they're going to find themselves in a position where they get choked off in a way that far exceeds anything we do\u2014anything we do.\n\nSo it took a long time sitting with my counterparts and saying: \"Look, we're going to block oil, but I'm not going to ask you to do it. I'm going to say to you, 'You do what you can. I'm going to explain why it's not rational for you to do the same thing. In the meantime, we're going to help you get energy through liquefied natural gas and a whole range of other things.'\"\n\nThe point is: Revoking PNTR for Russia has made it harder for Russia to do business with the United States. But in doing it with unison with our allies that, kept together, make up half the global economy\u2014half of it\u2014is a crushing blow to Russia.\n\nAlong with our partners and allies, we've stepped up pressure on corrupt Russian billionaires. We're increasing coordination among the G-7 countries and\u2014to target, capture the ill-begotten gains\u2014the yachts. You see some of these yachts\u2014450 feet long. No, I'm serious. Hundreds of millions of dollars in value. Their luxury apartments.\n\nThe totality of our economic sanctions and export controls are crushing\u2014crushing the Russian economy. The ruble has lost\u2014and I know many of you know this in detail\u2014lost more than half its value. You know what the value of a ruble is versus a dollar? You need 200 rubles to equal $1 today\u2014200.\n\nThe Moscow stock exchange is closed for a simple reason. I get asked, \"Well, why is it closed?\" Because\u2014for the last 2 weeks\u2014because the moment it opens, it will be disbanded. You hear me? It will blow up.\n\nCredit-rating agencies have downgraded Russia's Government to \"junk\" status\u2014\"junk\" status. And the list of private businesses and international corporations leaving Russia is growing day by day by day.\n\nI want to be clear though: We're going to make sure Ukraine has the weapons to defend themselves from invading Russian force. And we will send money and food aid to save Ukrainian lives.\n\nWe're going to welcome Ukrainian refugees with open arms if, in fact, they come all the way here. And as we provide this support to Ukraine, we're going to continue to stand together with our allies in Europe and send an unmistakable message that we will defend every inch of NATO territory\u2014every single inch\u2014with a united, galvanized NATO. One movement.\n\nThat's why I've moved over 12,000 American forces along the borders with Russia\u2014Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Romania, et cetera\u2014because they move once. Granted, if we respond, it is World War III, but we have a sacred obligation on NATO territory\u2014a sacred obligation\u2014article 5. And we will not\u2014although we will not fight the Third World War in Ukraine. Putin's war against Ukraine was never going to be a victory.\n\nDemocrats * are rising to meet the moment, relying\u2014rallying the world on the side of peace and security. We are showing a strength, and we'll never falter.\n\nBut look, the idea\u2014the idea that we're going to send in offensive equipment and have planes and tanks and trains going in with American pilots and American crews, just understand\u2014and don't kid yourself, no matter what you all say\u2014that's called \"World War III.\" Okay? Let's get it straight here, guys. That old expression: \"Don't kid a kidder.\"\n\nNow, I'd like to speak to our broader purpose here today to remind everybody where we were a year ago, where we've gotten since, the direction we're headed in. And all of you know that today is the anniversary, as Nancy said, since we passed the American Rescue Plan within the first month in office, thank God. Thank God you did it.\n\nAnybody's thought\u2014we're going to pass a bill that's 1 trillion, 900 billion dollars? We're going to do that? Yes, you did it. I asked you, and you did it. Few pieces of legislation\u2014no hyperbole\u2014in American history have done more to lift this country out of a crisis than what you did.\n\nIt took about 2 million Americans before I was\u2014before I was sworn in, 2 million Americans had been vaccinated. Today, because of the efforts you've\u2014what you've voted for, we have more than 215 million Americans fully vaccinated.\n\nYou all remember the lines of cars\u2014you remember? Nice-looking cars, stretched for hours and hours to\u2014 \u2014just to get a box of food. Well, guess what? Stretching those miles and miles no longer is happening. That box of food is not only in the table\u2014in the trunk. Because of that law, 41 million people put food on their table and are putting it on the table who wouldn't have been able to.\n\nBecause of that law, we helped to keep a roof over 4 million people's heads who were about to be evicted. And we gave families what my dad used to call \"just a little breathing room.\" Just a little bit of breathing room.\n\nBecause we took action, we created 6.7 million jobs last year, more than any other time in American history. And we haven't stopped. Last month, we created over 7\u2014678,000 jobs in February to get us well over 7 million jobs.\n\nUnemployment is down * 3.8 percent. The economy grew 5.7 percent\u2014the best economic growth in the last four decades. And the leading financial firm on Wall Street, Moody's, estimates that because of the Rescue Plan, 4 million more jobs were created, unemployment is 2 percent lower than it would have been and\u2014had we failed to ask. And it didn't cause the inflation.\n\nLook, there's more to the story than that. Many of you remember when we went through that last financial crisis in 2008. I had the dubious distinction of the President standing before all of you and said, \"And Sheriff Joe is going take care of the Recovery Act.\" Well, guess what? The economy recovered, but underneath the recovery, just like the\u2014like every other recovery in our history, there was a lot of pain\u2014a lot of pain.\n\nRepublicans in Congress refused to give President Obama the additional recovery funds he asked for. And the truth is, a lot of folks never got back on their feet. A whole lot of young people saw their futures dimmed, diminished. They didn't get back on track.\n\nAnd what's\u2014economists called the \"economic scarring\" that occurred as a consequence of that recession: the chronic pain when an economy comes back but some of the folks were left behind, and left behind almost permanently, trapped in long-term unemployment, evictions, and foreclosures.\n\nStudy after study showed that when you're stuck in that cycle, it has the worst impact on your emotional health and that of your children and your family members that you can imagine. And that's serious.\n\nSo when I came to office in the midst of this crisis, I was determined not to let that happen. Together, we made the choice to ask for all that we needed, to leave nobody behind, to minimize the pain and the hopelessness and the despair that so many had just lost their jobs, lost everything through no fault of their own.\n\nAnd look what happened. It isn't just that the unemployment rate has dropped at a record pace. We've also seen the biggest drop in long-term unemployment ever recorded in American history: nearly 2.5 million Americans who got to break out of that cycle of long-term unemployment.\n\nWe've seen the most significant drop in Black and Hispanic unemployment ever recorded. Black employment * fell by more than 30 percent. Hispanic fell\u2014Hispanic employment\u2014unemployment fell by 9 percent to 4.4 percent.\n\nWe've seen the lowest child poverty rate ever recorded: 40 percent decline in child poverty. The lowest number of harm\u2014home foreclosures ever recorded, down to less than a third of what they were we were before the pandemic. Record low credit card delinquencies because families had money in their pockets.\n\nThe list goes on. We've got a long way to go, though. I'm not saying we're over; we're just getting going. And a lot of work to do. But never forget what we've accomplished together so far.\n\nAnd, by the way, the American people just trying to stay above water don't understand this. You tell them what the American Recovery Act was, and they look at you like, \"What are you talking about?\" Understandably. They're like my family: mom, dad, four kids, grandpop living in the house in a three-bedroom split-level home. Just every single day figuring out how you put enough food on the table even when things are okay.\n\nWell\u2014and on this one anniversary of the American Rescue Plan, let's be clear: We did it alone, without one single, solitary Republican vote. The American economy was flat on its back. It was the Democrats, it was you\u2014\u2014\n\nAudience member. Yes!\n\nThe President. \u2014\u2014that brought us back. And you didn't stop there. You invested in America.\n\nIn fact, you passed the biggest investment of rebuilding the Nation in history. Now, it's true we got some Republicans friends to help on their for\u2014on the Recovery\u2014on\u2014excuse me, on the Infrastructure Act. But we're talking how many in the House\u201412, 13, 14, or something? Whatever it was.\n\nAudience member. Thirteen!\n\nAudience member. Thirteen.\n\nThe President. Thirteen. I mean, come on. I mean, I was happy for them, don't get me wrong. And then every one of them got attacked.\n\nLook, have\u2014but have you noticed that every new bridge, every trench dug to put in the\u2014to take out lead pipes, every trench dug, there's a Republican standing there saying, \"This is a great thing.\" \"Wonderful.\" \"We did it.\" Even Mitch McConnell, for God's sake.\n\nYou know, as we say in my outfit, \"Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. This has been so much since the last confession.\"\n\nLook, the simple fact is: This infrastructure bill is going to transform America. I mean, not figuratively, literally transform America. And it's already starting.\n\nInstead of having \"Infrastructure Week,\" we have an \"Infrastructure Decade\" we voted for. Okay? We got 4,000 projects all across the country, including 1,500 bridges in disrepair that are starting to be repaired this year. This year. People back home need to know what's happening.\n\nBy the way, where's my Pittsburgh group? Where are you?\n\nAudience member. \n\nThe President. They're in Pittsburgh. Anyway, I just out\u2014was out in Pittsburgh. That bridge\u2014you saw that bridge; it was devastating. I stood there about that bridge that had gone down an hour before I got there. Over a hundred-foot fall. Only a couple folks on that bridge. And if it had been 2 hours later, school buses would have been filled, children would have died. I mean, it was\u2014you saw the pictures in the paper. You ought to stand there and lean over and look at it.\n\nLook, we need to tell the American people this law is going to create millions of jobs rebuilding roads and bridges, airports and ports, internet, and a whole range of other things. Because that's what it's going to do.\n\nAnd that's why\u2014I'm not going to get into it right now, but that's why we have to make sure we have our education system up and running so we can produce the kind of workers we need, et cetera.\n\nBut it's going to start to get rid of the poisonous lead pipes as well so our kids and families can drink clean water. There's 10 million homes with lead pipes in America. And some of you on the health committee know the incredible studies done on the impact of lead on the brain of children and children's development. Four hundred thousand schools.\n\nWe're going to invest $65 billion to deliver affordable high-speed internet everywhere in America: urban, suburban, Tribal, city. And, by the way, we can't be\u2014this is the United States of America. We can't be the country where for a mom to get her kid on the internet to be able to do their homework has to pull into a McDonald's parking lot. I mean, for real, that's what was happening.\n\nThis law is going to put an end to all of that. It's going to put people in a much different position to be able to determine their own judgments about when to sell their cattle, when they should\u2014I just\u2014we're going to change things.\n\nBut look, we all know that despite the progress we've made, families are still struggling. They're struggling with higher prices. As I said, I grew up in a family\u2014when the price of gas went up, everybody felt it. You talked about it. It mattered. It mattered.\n\nBut let's be absolutely clear about why prices are so high right now. They're very high for two reasons, notwithstanding what the Republicans say: COVID, number one. What happened was, the way the global economy works: If a factory in Taiwan makes computer chips, shuts down because of COVID, it causes a ripple effect that can slow down the manufacturing in Detroit, which it did. One hitch can hold up everything.\n\nBecause of the pandemic, we've had disruptions in our supply chain materials and port materials. At the same time, the strength and speed of our economic recovery and families making more money still kept up. So here you had the\u2014an unusual situation that, during a pandemic, people had money to spend. But what they didn't do is they didn't want to go to restaurants. They didn't want to go out and go on vacations. They didn't spend money on leisure activities. So they wanted to spend it on other things: on hard goods, home improvements, televisions, additions to their homes, the very products that slowed down by disruptions in the supply chain, because there weren't people cutting 2 by 4s. Because of COVID, they were shut down.\n\nI could go on and list\u2014you all know this. I'm preaching to the choir here.\n\nSo what happened? Prices went up exponentially. Just take a look at automobiles last year. One-third of all the inflation in America last year was because of the price of automobiles. People had the money to buy automobiles, finally. But because the companies couldn't get semiconductors, they couldn't make the automobiles. The result: The price of automobiles skyrocketed.\n\nAnd used cars\u2014the reason used cars went up is because when the COVID hit and the leisure industry shut down, the rental cars sold all their stock. So people were in real trouble.\n\nThe second big reason for inflation is Vladimir Putin. From the moment he put his over 150,000 troops on the Ukrainian border, the price of gasoline in * January went up 75 cents.\n\nAnd Putin began amassing troops along the border, and guess what? The world took notice. And those of you who work in the business know that the market anticipated and pricing went up more. And then Putin invaded.\n\nMake no mistake, inflation is largely the fault of Putin. I love\u2014you know, the Republicans are saying it's \"Biden's gas pipeline\"\u2014\"Biden said he's going to stop the Keystone Pipeline\"\u2014and I did\u2014\"and that's the reason prices went up.\"\n\nFolks, let's get something straight here: The Keystone Pipeline was 2 years away. It had been 2-percent finished. Give me a break. Give me a break.\n\nHeadline, fact checker in the New York Times: \"Republicans Wrongly Blame Biden for Rising Gas Prices.\" And it goes on to explain why gas prices are so high.\n\nWashington Post op-ed by Dana Milbank, \"Opinion: Biden Heeded Republicans' Plea To Ban Russian Oil. They Pounced.\" And it goes on to talk about why it's got\u2014don't let anybody tell you anything you did supporting the idea that we block Russian oil coming into the country, which is\u2014and I said at the time prices are going to go up for gasoline. It wasn't anything we did.\n\nAnd by the way, you're in a situation right now where if you take a look, the idea can we\u2014\"can we pump more oil?\" There are now 5\u2014there are 172 gas and oil rigs running. Now we have\u2014there were 519 in operation before this all began.\n\nBut guess what? They have over 7,000 permits to dig oil if they want. Why aren't they out pumping oil? Why aren't they out pumping oil? Because they've said and they're very clear\u2014Wall Street bankers have made it very clear\u2014not a joke, check it out. And I recommend these two articles to you, just as a little bit of a primer. You probably already know it.\n\nWhat's happened? Well, the oil companies and executives, they don't want to pump more oil, although they have every capacity to do so. Nothing is slowing them up from doing it if they want to.\n\nWhy? Rather than spend the profits on the increased price of gasoline, they would rather take those profits and buy back stock\u2014buy back their own stock, rather than take that money and invest it in pumping new oil. Not a joke. Not a joke.\n\nSo don't tell me gas prices rose because I've slowed down the American energy production. In my first year in office, American production grew by 9.7 million barrels a day to 11.6 million while we still made a major, major effort to deal with global warming and changing the way in which we shift to renewable energy.\n\nAnd don't tell me gas prices rose because of the American Rescue Plan. The San Francisco Reserve\u2014Federal Reserve analyzed this and other outfits confirm: The Rescue Plan contributed to 0.3 percent of inflation\u20140.3 inflation.\n\nThey're the facts. Democrats didn't cause this problem. Vladimir Putin did.\n\nAnd we're\u2014and we are working on it to fix it. Because of the work we did, this country is vaccinated and started building the economy from the bottom up in the middle out. Something incredible is happening.\n\nWe're seeing a manufacturing revival I don't think even those of you from the Midwest thought would occur. The pride that comes from stamping products \"Made in America.\" Intel came to see me\u2014the CEO. He said he wants to invest $20 billion to build factories in eastern Ohio\u2014manufacture computer chips, semiconductors that power the world and everyday lives, smartphones, intel, technology that doesn't exist today.\n\nAnd they're prepared to increase their investment from $20 billion now to $100 billion now, as soon as you get final passage of the innovation bill headed to conference now.\n\nThis bill will invest another $200 billion to make us competitive, including $52 billion in computer chips. We invented these damn things. We, the United States\u2014everybody forgets\u2014we invented the computer chip, in going to the Moon. And we have made\u2014every single, solitary part of modernizing the technology in a computer chip has been American made.\n\nBut we stopped making them in America, and now we're going to make them again. That's going to help bring down the price of automobiles, appliances, and so much more.\n\nAnd it's not just Intel. Take a look at what Ford and General Motors did. Ford committed $11 billion to build electric vehicles in America, its biggest investment ever. General Motors committed $7 billion to build electric vehicles.\n\nRemember when General Motors\u2014Mary Barra\u2014was suing California? Suing California because there's a higher standard\u2014mileage standard? I talked to her. And I'm not saying she changed because of me. I talked to her. She came to\u2014called me and said she's no\u2014she's going to drop her suit and that she's going to commit that 50 percent of all General Motors vehicles by the year 2030 are going to be electric vehicles. And everybody started following suit.\n\nJust a few years ago, companies might have built these factories elsewhere, but now they're building them in America. We're coming back. We're coming back stronger than ever before.\n\nAnd, by the way, one of the things I've done\u2014you know, I didn't know\u2014maybe you all knew it; I didn't know when I was in the Senate; I should have\u2014that there's law on the books. It's called \"Build America.\" You're allowed to insist\u2014I get to spend, as your President\u2014allocate spending of $600 billion: everything from the decks of aircraft carriers to a whole range of\u2014fleet of automobile\u2014all the things we spend money on in the Government.\n\nWell, the law says that the President of the United States can say all those products have to be made in America.\n\nWell, what happened? Initially, we just got really lax\u2014Democrats and Republicans, I might add\u2014and said, \"Here's the deal: If it has 55 percent American-made product and 45 is from foreign sources, that's okay.\" Not in my book.\n\nSo I just signed an Executive order saying it's got to be a minimum of 75 percent to start; it's going to go up. And I think it's the third Executive order I signed that no department can give a waiver for a non-American-made product in any American product we're buying without my permission, without coming to the White House to determine whether or not that's justified.\n\nAnd know what's happening now? A lot of minority businesses, small businesses getting in on the deal. It gets posted\u2014there's an office in the White House\u2014that says: \"This is a product being built. We can't find contractors for this with an American product. Here's what we need.\" And guess what? It's increasing the number of small businesses.\n\nWe also know that there's no one way to increase the standard of living. Putin's gas tax has pushed prices up higher; it will take American manufacturing to bring prices of cars down. But in the meantime, we can save people money in a big way by reducing the cost of childcare, of insulin, of caring for mom and dad and their energy bills. Because that's another way to fundamentally impact on inflation for a family.\n\nAnd it gets down to what's the total amount of money you have to spend to meet your basic needs. So guess what? If you\u2014instead of the 200,000 folks with kids with type 1 diabetes, if instead of spending an average of $647 a month for that insulin, as high as $1,000, you're only paying $35, you've saved a hell of a lot of money.\n\nThink about your parents, particularly single parents, particularly women out there\u2014the cost of childcare. Look, when I got here, as Nancy and some of you know, I had lost my family with an automobile accident. I got a call saying my wife was dead and my daughter was dead and my two boys were very badly injured. And I hadn't been sworn in yet.\n\nAnd make a long\u2014an awful lot of help from a lot of Senators saying: \"Come and stay just 6 months. Help us organize.\"\n\n \n\nBoy, was I stupid. Six months. But they saved my sanity.\n\nAnd so I came. And everybody says, \"God, that\u2014ain't that Joe Biden a wonderful guy? He commuted every single day, roughly 300 miles a day, 4 hours a day, just to be home with his kids.\"\n\nIt's true, I did. I tried to hit over 2 million-some miles on Amtrak. But here's the deal: I did it because I could not afford childcare. I couldn't even begin to think of it. And I was making\u2014I was making, at that time, as a United States Senator\u2014I was making more money than I made before. I couldn't afford it.\n\nSo I think it's\u2014anybody making 100,000 bucks a year, single person, or 120 as a family, should have childcare capped at 7 percent of their income. Period. Period.\n\nWe can do that. That will cut the cost of childcare in half. And a family is paying 14 grand a year in San Francisco, Philadelphia\u2014all the big cities of the country\u2014for just one child. And look, that extra 7,000 bucks in their pocket will make a difference in what they can do.\n\nThere's so much we can do. Let me be clear: None of this is going to increase inflation.\n\nSeventeen Nobel laureates spontaneously, a month-and-a-half ago, wrote to me. Seventeen Nobel laureates in the economic\u2014in economics wrote me a long paper saying this will have\u2014this will help ease inflationary pressures over time. Not increase it\u2014ease. And we can do this without raising one single penny on taxes on anybody making less than 400 grand a year.\n\nLet me say that again, be crystal clear: No one making less than $400,000 a year will pay a single additional penny in tax for all these things that were in the Build Back Better plan.\n\nWe have to do this. We have to do this. We have to ask\u2014easy: Ask the biggest\u2014those of the biggest corporations who pay very little to raise their hand. Everybody in here, raise your hand if you think the existing tax structure is remotely fair. I'm not being\u2014I could do this at a Republican meeting, privately\u2014 \u2014and they'd say that\u2014no one would raise their hand.\n\nBut look, we have\u2014in 2020, 55 of the biggest corporations in America\u2014the Fortune 500\u2014paid zero in taxes and they made $40 billion in profit. Forty billion.\n\nYou know it, I know it, the American people know it: It just isn't right.\n\nLook, I'm a capitalist. This isn't about punishing anybody. I love Bernie, and I really do. He's a great friend. But I'm not Bernie.\n\nIf you can make a billion dollars, make it, but for God's sake, pay your fair share for\u2014damn it. Right now. But why are teachers and firefighters paying a higher percentage of taxes than billionaires and corporations, which is literally true? Literally true.\n\nAnd we can fix this. We can raise the standard of living for hard-working people without raising taxes, without raising inflation, and without raising the deficit.\n\nAnd for all those folks out there that like to attack us for, you know\u2014let me remind them: Last year, because of what you all did, we reduced the deficit by $360 billion\u2014we, the Democrats\u2014while the economy grew. We're on track right now\u2014I'm on track to be the first President in history to lower the deficit by over $1 trillion in 1 year.\n\nSo I'm sick of this stuff. We have to talk about it because the American people think the reason for inflation is the Government is spending more money. Simply not true.\n\nI don't think we need any lectures from our friends on the other side about fiscal responsibility, for God's sake. Look, we have an ambitious agenda. So let's go get it done. That includes standing up for and not giving an inch on core Democratic values.\n\nWe're going to continue to stand up to meet the great challenges of our time: voting rights, climate change, gun violence, criminal justice, immigration, and so much more.\n\nComing out of the State of the Union\u2014why I think we're in a strong position\u2014we have a record to be proud of, an agenda that will lower costs for American families and lift this Nation up, and a message that resonates. We're building a better America, a fairer America, a more decent America. A country that's been through a lot these past few years.\n\nAnd I mean what I said\u2014I meant what I said at the State of the Union: We're stronger today than we were a year ago. And we will be stronger next year than we are today.\n\nI've long said\u2014and I mean this sincerely. I'm not\u2014I've spent a lot of time with Xi Jinping. Over 36 hours of private meetings with him. He asked me\u2014we were in the Tibetan Plateau and he asked me if I could define America for him. Just me and a simultaneous interpreter, him and an interpreter. And by the way, I turned all my notes over. Okay? \n\nBut seriously, he said, \"Can you define America for me?\" He's a tough guy. And I said, \"I can.\" And I said, \"In one word.\" And he looked at me. I said, \"Possibilities.\" We're the only nation in the world\u2014it's the reason why we're looked at as sometimes being arrogant. We think anything is possible. Anything is possible if we act together.\n\nLook, we've taken every crisis we ever faced and turned it into an opportunity. Think of one that hadn't happened that way. Whatever the crisis was, we've come out of it better than we were in before it occurred, every single time. But we've got to stick together. We've got to stick together. We can do this again. We can do it.\n\nLook, I\u2014I'm going to get going. I shouldn't\u2014I'll stop here. I know you all have questions, and I'm supposed\u2014anyway, thank you, thank you, thank you. And I'll be back here for questions. Thank you.",
