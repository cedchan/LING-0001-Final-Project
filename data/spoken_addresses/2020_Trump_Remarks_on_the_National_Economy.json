We've never broken 30,000. And that's despite everything that's taken place with the pandemic. I'm very thrilled with what's happened on the vaccine front. That's been absolutely incredible. It's\u2014nothing like that has ever happened medically. And I think people are acknowledging that, and it's having a big effect.\n\n\nBut the stock market has just broken 30,000. Never been broken, that number. That's a sacred number: 30,000. Nobody thought they'd ever see it. That's the ninth time since the beginning of 2020, and it's the 48th time that we've broken records in\u2014during the Trump administration. And I just want to congratulate all the people within the administration that worked so hard. And most importantly, I want to congratulate the people of our country, because there are no people like you.\n\n\nThank you very much, everybody. Thank you.",
