    "text": "Folks, we're going to have a meeting today to talk about the critical supply chain issues that we\u2014that affect us all, affect this country.\n\nThe last year has shown the vulnerability we have with some of the supply chains, including the PPE that we needed badly, but had to go abroad to get. And there are current strategies\u2014and these little chips here for automobiles that I didn't realize how many billions of chips are in here\u2014but causing some lines to slow down and people not being laid off, but at least to shorten the shifts.\n\nAnd so we're going to talk about that. John Cornyn and this\u2014again, this is a bipartisan group here\u2014put together an effort last year that I think was a pretty good effort, dealing with how to deal with these chips, but there's other aspects of shortages as well. That's what we're going to talk about. And it's nice to have everybody down here, and\u2014on a subject matter we all agree on, and figure out how we get it all done.\n\nSo thank you all for coming on in, and I appreciate it.",
