Today I'm joined by Senator Cardin\u2014Ben Cardin; Elissa Slotkin; and the Congresswoman Victoria Spatz\u2014Spartz, excuse me, who\u2014I was just talking to her about still having family back in Ukraine. God love you.\n\nI\u2014we're going to\u2014I'm about to sign a bill that these folks are responsible\u2014and of course, the Vice President, excuse me. Excuse me. The\u2014I'm signing a bill that provides another important tool in our efforts to support the Government of Ukraine and the Ukrainian people in their fight to defend their country and their democracy against Putin's brutal war. And it is brutal. I want to thank Members of Congress here for getting this passed and everyone who supported the bill. And the bill demonstrates that support for Ukraine is pivotal at this moment.\n\nEvery day, Ukrainians pay with their lives, and they fight the long\u2014and the atrocities that the Russians are engaging in are just beyond the pale. And the cost of the fight is not cheap, but caving to aggression is even more costly. That's why we're staying in this.\n\nYesterday we celebrated V-E Day\u2014Victory in Europe Day\u2014marking the end of a transition of the devastation as a consequence of World War II and allied nations' defeat of the scourge of fascism in Europe. And today Europe is honoring another important day, an anniversary.

The idea ultimately grew into the, what is now, 27-nation European Union, an economic powerhouse and a global force for peace and close partners of all\u2014on all the issues we face.\n\nAnd it really has\u2014I've said from the very beginning: It's something that is good for everyone. It brings these countries together in ways that\u2014and they cooperate closely economically. They also cooperate in other ways. And you've seen it in their support for Ukraine.\n\nAnd with Putin's war once more bringing wanton destruction into Europe, and to reaffirm the enduring commitment to the future grounded in democracy, human rights, and peaceful resolution to disagreements, I'm now going to sign this bill.\n\nAnd again, I thank my colleagues who are standing behind me. And\u2014because it really matters. It matters.\n\n \n\nThere you go. Done. Thank you.",
