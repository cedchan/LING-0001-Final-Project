    "text": "The President. Thank you very much, Nancy. That was very kind. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thanks.\n\nFather, before I begin\u2014bless me, Father, for I'm about to sin. [ Laughter ] I\u2014well, I just want you to know, I may be Irish, but I'm not stupid. I married Dominic Giacoppa's daughter. [ Laughter ] Okay? \n\nLook, thank you very much, Nancy, for that very gracious and very over-the-top introduction. I appreciate it very much.\n\nYou know, I just got off the\u2014on the way up, before I came up here, I was on the Zoom, as we say, with the Taoiseach for about 45 minutes. And he is\u2014he's looking well, he feels well. He's tested positive, but he feels well. He looks good. And he wanted to\u2014I know the Ambassador is here to bring his regards, but he is\u2014he's really sorry he can't be here, and he was looking forward to it, as was his wife.\n\nYou know, the good spirits and feelings, as well, that exist on St. Patrick's Day seems to be one of those few times and not\u2014well, not\u2014I shouldn't say \"a few\"\u2014we should have more times like this where Democrats and Republicans get together, and we actually not only agree on one thing, but we remind ourselves we actually like each other. [ Laughter ] And it's a useful thing. And, I\u2014 \u2014you know, Yeats wrote, and I quote, \"Talent perceives differences; genius, unity.\" \"Talents perceives differences; genius, unity.\" And, you know, I think today we can add a fifth item to at least my unity agenda, and that's support of our relationship between Ireland and the United States, which has taken on an even more intense and cooperative form than it ever has, because of Ireland's neutrality.\n\nOn this issue, it brings together Speaker Pelosi, Leader McCarthy, Richie Neal\u2014who is Irish, as we say where I come from, from the belt buckle to shoe sole\u2014 \u2014and\u2014and the leaders of both our parties, and all the Friends of Ireland.\n\nI\u2014you know, I'm the proud son of Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden. And like so many Americans of Irish heritage, I love Ireland and I was raised in a circumstance where you would have thought my whole family\u2014none of\u2014they came in 1844 and 1845, but you'd think they'd all lived in Ireland the last 60 years\u2014the previous 60 years.\n\nThe\u2014there's\u2014as I was talking to Taoiseach today, the Irish on St. Patrick's Day think that\u2014Irish Americans think they're more Irish than the Irish. And\u2014but that's kind of how I was raised, like so many Americans of Irish heritage, like other people of other heritage as well.\n\nI was\u2014it was imbued in me to be proud of\u2014proud of my heritage. And, you know, the pride that was passed down to generations of our family, even though they've been here since the mid-1800s. And it was just part of the air we breathed, especially up in Scranton and\u2014where we lived with my\u2014near my grandpop.\n\nMy grandfather, Ambrose Finnegan, used to say\u2014and I mean this\u2014he'd say, \"Joey, if you're lucky enough to be Irish, you're lucky enough.\" [ Laughter ] Every time something bad happened, I'd go, \"I don't\u2014I'm not sure.\" Anyway.\n\nBut because of being an Irish family, family was everything. My dad's expression was, \"Family is the beginning, the middle, and the end.\" And\u2014and he meant it.\n\nAnd\u2014but, you know, the faith we share with one another and the resilience that we've all gone through, both in America and in Ireland, you know, are ones that we've been knocked down sometimes. Just knocked flat on our back.\n\nAnd my\u2014my mom's expression, for real, was: \"Joey, get up. Just get up. Get up.\" It's a simple proposition. It was sort of the Irish of it. You just get up, no matter what. Dust yourself off and move. Not\u2014we're not the only culture that has that view, but it was imbued in my family.\n\nAnd the other one was that\u2014and I mean this sincerely\u2014my dad's: \"No one is better than you, and you're no better than anyone else.\" Not a joke. \"No one is better than you, but you're no better than anyone else.\" And it's real. It's real. Because we were taught never\u2014as my mother would say, \"Never bow, never bend, never yield.\"\n\nBut the truth of the matter was that in the days when my parents and grandparents were growing up in the coal country of Scranton, being Irish was less than a badge of honor.\n\nMy great grandfather Blewitt, on\u2014my grandmother Finnegan's maiden name\u2014was only the second Catholic ever elected to the Senate in the State of\u2014in the State of Pennsylvania. And that was 1907, and only the second one. The first one was in, I think, 1838 or 1840.\n\nThe point was that, like many cultures, like many folks, where you came from was either viewed as an asset or a liability. And where\u2014you know, but the point is that everything that we were taught\u2014and I'm sure all of you of Irish background, and other backgrounds as well, were taught that\u2014that, you know, it's all about striving for a better future; that you can do better\u2014just simply do better. And you know\u2014and you can do it while you cherish the past. Now, you don't have to forget the past, or disassociate yourself from it, but cherish it.\n\nYou know, these are the values of immigrants not only from Ireland, but from\u2014like my great-great-grandparents when they were brought here\u2014brought themselves to the United States. But today, it's only part of what it means to be Irish. There is an indelible part of it that is American, because the values are the same, in my view\u2014the values built into our Constitution that we are the\u2014I\u2014you heard me say last night: I think we're the most unique country in the history of the world. We're the only country based upon\u2014organizationally\u2014not geography, not ethnicity, not race, not religion, but on a notion, an idea that we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal, endowed by their Creator, with certain inalienable rights: life, liberty.\n\nI mean, that's the basis of why we formed this country. No other country has ever been based on a notion like that. They've incorporated those notions, but the basis for their organization has been their ethnicity, their religion, their geography\u2014whatever\u2014but not here.\n\nAnd I know I say it, and many of you say\u2014and I think people wonder whether we really mean it: I really think the source of our strength is our diversity. The source of our strength is our diversity.\n\nAnd, you know, there are values that immigrants from Ireland brought and\u2014but they're\u2014as I said, they're not only\u2014they're not only Irish values, they're values, I think, of the vast majority of immigrants who come to the United States.\n\nAnd I'm proud to say that the bond between Ireland and the United States, by the way, has grown deeper and stronger over the years. For real. And we've navigated a once-in-a-century pandemic together. We've grieved the loss of too many people in both our countries. And we worked to rebuild our economies and taken on the challenge of renewing and strengthening our democracy, because\u2014again, I apologize for repeating myself, but I know many of you've heard me say I think we're at an inflection point in history. I think\u2014and I mean that sincerely. And it occurs every several generations. I think we're in a genuine struggle between autocracies and democracies, and whether or not democracies can be sustained.\n\nAnd I\u2014I'm going to be speaking to President Xi tomorrow. And he'll remind me that I told him\u2014he remembers every damn thing I've said, unfortunately. But all kidding aside, we talk about the idea he\u2014that he does not believe demo\u2014democracies can be sustained in the 21st century because things move so rapidly, technology is changing so much, democracies don't have time to arrive at consensus. That's why autocracies will succeed.\n\nWell, you know, and now\u2014you know, we\u2014you have Ireland stepping up not only in terms of the relationship with us but, you know, the Good Friday Agreement is built on political and economic progress that we've made together.\n\nAnd I know some criticize me, but I've be\u2014I have a good relationship with the Prime Minister of Great Britain, Boris. We always kid each other when we see each other. But the point is that I've made it clear that\u2014I don't think I just speak for myself\u2014the Good Friday Agreements are firmly, firmly, firmly, firmly supported here in the United States. And we insist that it occur, they be maintained because it's\u2014 \u2014too hard.\n\nThe people of Northern Ireland have made significant changes as well. There's movement, as you've mentioned\u2014the young kids you talked about\u2014Protestant and Catholic\u2014talking to how\u2014I mean, how they've never known anything but being able to get along.\n\nI remember the first time I\u2014on my parents' 50th wedding anniversary, my brothers and sister, we got together and gave my\u2014and we can work something out for you, Father\u2014we gave my parents a trip to Ireland. And\u2014but it coincided\u2014I was going over to the Stormont talks. And so they said, \"You take them, Joey.\" \n\nAnd\u2014but the point is that it was\u2014it was an\u2014a bit of an epiphany for my parents. They thought\u2014you hear all the stories from your ancestors about this, that, and the other thing\u2014some of it apocryphal, some of it real. But it was really amazing.\n\nBut when we took them to the north, it was interesting. We went up to the Stormont and\u2014anyway, they\u2014it was an interesting thing to watch\u2014to watch the look on my mother's face and my father's face as we toured Ireland, to see both the things that they had heard that were consistent with what they heard, because you never know whether they\u2014you know, there's exaggeration about, \"Well, when\u2014when this happened and that happened.\" But they came back more hopeful than they had ever been as opposed to\u2014and that was a while ago.\n\nBut my generic point is that, you know, now you have Ireland and Great Britain, and, you know, the Republic standing together against a murderous dictator, a pure thug, who is waging an immoral war against the people of Ukraine.\n\nAnd by the way, the Republic is paying a big price for this, a big number for supporting the strategy\u2014for supporting the sanctions, including a whole range of things. This\u2014it's not a minor contribution they're making in this effort. It's significant.\n\nIreland and the United States are working together. For the first time now, they're on the United Nations Security Council. Ireland is a part of the Security Council now and the European Union. And Putin is paying a big price for his aggression. And they are part of the reason this cost is going so high.\n\nThat's a little\u2014you know, everybody talks about Germany having stepped up and changed the notions about being more leaning forward. But\u2014and they have. Well, so is Ireland. So is Ireland\u2014a neutral country. Ireland has stepped up and taking a hit for what they're doing.\n\nAnd you\u2014look, you know, ladies and gentlemen, the relationship between Ireland and the United States is a dynamic and, I think, essential partnership that\u2014as much as it's ever been. And, you know, it's sustained and strengthened by the Friends of Ireland, in this room and all across the country. And, you know, the connections that link our people stretch back through history, and they forward\u2014well forward, I believe, in the future.\n\nYou know, we share a common goal: a future of a greater peace, greater hope, greater security, and a greater sense of who we are as countries.\n\nAnd, you know, I\u2014my mother's expression, gotten from her grandfather, was, you know: As long as you're alive, you have an obligation to strive. And you're not dead until you've seen the face of God.\n\nThat's what I think of when I think of Ireland. All the troubles they've been through, they have never, ever, ever quit. Never, ever, ever, ever quit\u2014not once. They've gotten up. And now they're beginning to at least have the benefits of all the hard work and labor they've engaged in, and they're becoming a real actor, Mr. Ambassador, on the world stage and at the United Nations.\n\nAnd so I want to thank you, Mr. Ambassador, and I thank the Taoiseach today.\n\nAnd I just\u2014I should probably tell you that my mother, when I took\u2014when we went to Ireland, and we were\u2014we were in the south, and my father was a real gentleman. And his greatest regret was he never had a college education.\n\nBut if I were\u2014if you or any one of you were coming back to Delaware with me and my dad were around or retired, and I didn't call him to tell him I was bringing you over to introduce him so he had a chance to put on a coat and a tie\u2014because he would only see you that way\u2014that was my dad.\n\nAnd as we were going to Ireland\u2014FitzGerald was the Taoiseach\u2014and we walked in to have a picture taken. And my dad had his brandnew blazer that had a\u2014a patch on of my brother-in-law, Jack Owens\u2014who's Irish from\u2014like you, Neal. And it was this patch\u2014this crest. And it had Latin written on it. And I never took the time to look at it, although I had to take 4 years of Latin\u20143 years of Latin in the Catholic high school I went to.\n\nAnd the Taoiseach\u2014we're having our picture taken, and he said, \"Oh, Mr. Biden\"\u2014he said, \"I agree.\" And what it said in Latin was, \"Don't let the bastards get you down.\" \n\nWell, we can't let them get us down. You can't let them get us down.\n\nThank you for allowing me to come back home, come up here and speak. And thank you, Nancy, for the nice compliments.\n\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi. As the President has to make a clean exit to go back to work, I wanted all of us to lift our glass to toast the President on this St. Patrick's Day.\n\nMr. President, this is a toast that I learned from my grandchildren; I've said it to our colleagues here before. And it goes like this. It's an Irish toast: Sing as is if no one can hear you. Dance as if no one can see you. Love as if you've loved\u2014never loved before. And live as if heaven is on Earth.\n\nSo when I said to them, \"Is that a toast that is a tradition in the Kenneally family?\" they say, \"No, that's a sign that is in the Shannon Airport.\" \n\nTo the President. Happy\u2014\u2014\n\nThe President. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker Pelosi. Thank you, Mr. President. Happy St. Patrick's Day.\n\nThe President. Well, my grandmother had one. She said, \"May those who love us, love us. And those who don't, may they turn their ankle so we know they're coming by their limp.\" ",
