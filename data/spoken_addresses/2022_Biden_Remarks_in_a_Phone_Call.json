Oh, but I think -- I think I should answer this one.\u00a0\n\nHello, Mr. President? I don't think I can hear you. Can you hear me, Mr. President? (Technical difficulties.) Hello? Happy Thanksgiving. Mr. President, are you there?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: We're here! (Laughs.)\n\nTHE FIRST LADY: Hi! Happy Thanksgiving.\n\nMS. GUTHRIE: Oh! (Laughs.) I was so worried this call wasn't going to go through. How are you?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: We're fine. We're fine. Watching your parade. You're doing a good job.\u00a0\n\nMS. GUTHRIE: Oh, thank you. I love that you're watching, like, the --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: You're responsible for the good weather of the parade, too. That's the best part.\n\nMS. GUTHRIE: I will take credit for that, yes. Thank you very much.\n\nAnd just like millions of Americans, you guys watching the parade, what do you want to say to everyone watching right now?\n\nTHE FIRST LADY: We just want to say we're so grateful for the people, for this opportunity, for the health that we have now in America. And just Happy Thanksgiving.\n\nJoe, what do you want to say?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I want to say thanks to the firefighters, the police officers, first responders. They never take a break.\n\nTHE FIRST LADY: And God bless our troops, for sure.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: And, by the way, we're going to be talking to some of our troops later today, both here and abroad. And I hope everybody remembers we end every single day with \"God bless our troops,\" for real.\n\nMS. GUTHRIE: That's so true. We are so grateful. And what are your plans for Thanksgiving, after the parade?\n\nTHE FIRST LADY: Well, we're just going to have dinner with the family, probably take a walk on the beach, and just feel gratitude for our family.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, we've been coming up to Nantucket for -- since we first got married, the whole family. And it's become a tradition. And we're going to go stop at the fire department. We're going to make sure that we spend some time on the island thanking the first responders here. And we're going to go see the Coast Guard, the military.\n\nMS. GUTHRIE: Well, that's wonderful and sounds absolutely lovely.\u00a0\n\nThank you, Mr. President and Dr. Biden, for taking the time to join us today. And I hope you have a wonderful Thanksgiving with your family.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: You too. Hope you get a little time to enjoy it. We're going to give Al a call too and see how he's doing.\n\nMS. GUTHRIE: Al is doing great. Thank you so much for asking.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: All right.\n\nTHE FIRST LADY: Happy Thanksgiving!\n\nMS. GUTHRIE: Happy Thanksgiving!",
