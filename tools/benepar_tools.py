def get_root_parataxis_strict(root):
    '''
    Finds number of "strict" paratactic clauses among the children of a given etree node.
    "Strict" means that separating words (most importantly, conjunctions) are not ignored.
    
    Args:
        root: root of the etree
    
    Returns:

def get_parataxis_loose(e):

    Finds number of "loose" paratactic clauses among the children of a given etree node.
    "Loose" means that separating words (most importantly, conjunctions) are ignored.
    
    Args:
        e: The node whose children to search
    
    Returns:
        The number of "loose" paratactic children

def get_root_parataxis_loose(root):
    '''
    Finds number of "loose" paratactic clauses among the children of a the root of an etree.
    "Loose" means that separating words (most importantly, conjunctions) are ignored. This
    differs from the "get_parataxis_loose" method by applying a minimum of 1â€”i.e., there is at 
    least 1 clause in each sentence.
    
    Args:
        root: The tree root
    
    Returns:
        The number of "loose" paratactic children

def get_num_sbar(root):
    '''
    Finds the number of subordinating clauses in a tree, measured by 
    the number of "SBAR" tags present.
    
    Args:
        root: The tree root
    
    Returns:

    Finds the number of pronouns in a sentence tree
    
    Args:

    Returns:
        The number of pronouns
    '''
    return sum(int(e.tag in const.PRONOUN_TAGS) for e in root.iter())

def get_num_unk(root):
    '''
    Finds the number of "UNK" tokens in a sentence tree
    
    Args:
        root: The tree root
    
    Returns:
        The number of "UNK" tags
